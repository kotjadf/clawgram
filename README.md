# Clawgram

Clawgram is a personal-Telegram channel plugin for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) — it connects as a regular Telegram user account (not a bot) via MTProto using [GramJS](https://github.com/gram-js/gramjs). Your AI assistant reads and responds as you.

> Clawgram is the actively maintained continuation of
> [eldaruma/telegram-userbot](https://github.com/eldaruma/telegram-userbot) (MIT).
>
> **Breaking change in 2.0.0:** the plugin id and channel name changed from
> `telegram-userbot` to `clawgram`. When upgrading from 1.x (or from the
> original telegram-userbot), rename the `channels.telegram-userbot` section of
> `openclaw.json` to `channels.clawgram` (contents stay as-is), update any
> `plugins.allow` entry, and replace `telegram-userbot:<target>` address
> prefixes with `clawgram:<target>`. Then restart the Gateway.

> **WARNING**: Using a user account for automated messaging may violate Telegram's Terms of Service. Use a dedicated secondary account. Your account could be banned or restricted.

> **What this plugin can do with your account.** It logs in as a *full Telegram user*, not a bot:
> it can read private and group conversations within its configured scope and send messages that are
> indistinguishable from ones you typed yourself. Recipients cannot tell an assistant reply from a
> human one. Treat the account as compromised-if-leaked: `apiHash` and `sessionString` are bearer
> credentials for everything that account can reach. Scope reads with `readChats`, scope sends with
> `sendChats`, gate senders with `allowFrom`, and prefer a dedicated account over your primary one —
> see [Security and privacy](#security-and-privacy).


## Features

- **MTProto Client API** — operates as a user account, not a bot
- **DM & Group support** — private chats, groups, supergroups, forum topics
- **Forum topic routing** — correctly routes replies to the right forum topic thread
- **@Mention detection** — respond only when mentioned in groups (text, caption, and ID-based mentions)
- **Read receipts** — mark messages as read
- **Emoji reactions** — acknowledge a message with a reaction instead of a reply (`react` action)
- **Editing what was sent** — rewrite the account's own message in place instead of posting a correction beneath it (`edit` action)
- **Chat metadata** — title, type, member count, description, forum flag and pinned message (`chatInfo` action)
- **Attachments on demand** — fetch the photo or voice note on any message in read scope, as a reading, a file, or both (`fetch-media` action)
- **Chat management** — create supergroups, add/remove members, promote/demote admins, transfer ownership, export invite links (`createGroup`, `addMembers`, `removeMember`, `promoteAdmin`, `demoteAdmin`, `transferOwnership`, `inviteLink`) — off until `manageChats` allows it
- **User allowlist** — control which user has access to send messages for direct
- **Chat allowlist** — control which chats the assistant can access
- **Multi-account** — run multiple Telegram accounts simultaneously
- **Per-group settings** — different behavior for different groups
- **SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy** — optional native MTProto proxy per account
- **Slash commands** — [slash commands](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/slash-commands) are available in DM to the connected account (`/status`, `/reset`, `/new`, etc.)


## Requirements

- OpenClaw >= 2026.5.27 — earlier releases carry published high-severity advisories
  (among them a pairing-scoped session that could restore revoked node-token authority, fixed in
  `2026.5.26`). Since this plugin reads messages and acts on an account, running it on a vulnerable
  Gateway widens the blast radius, so 2.1.0 refuses to install below `2026.5.26`. The floor is
  now `2026.5.27`, the first release whose `plugin-sdk/channel-inbound` and
  `plugin-sdk/channel-outbound` carry everything that used to come from `direct-dm` and
  `channel-runtime` — the two subpaths OpenClaw 2026.8 removed. Built and tested against
  `2026.7.1-2`; the SDK imports also resolve on 2026.8 and 2026.9.
- Telegram API credentials from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org)
- Node.js >= 22

## Installation

```bash
# from npm (default resolution)
openclaw plugins install clawgram

# or explicitly from ClawHub
openclaw plugins install clawhub:clawgram
```

## Setup

### 1. Get Telegram API credentials

- Go to https://my.telegram.org
- Log in with your phone number
- Go to "API development tools"
- Create a new application
- Copy the `api_id` and `api_hash`


### 2. Log in to your telegram account

Log in to your telegram account via cli using API credentials and phone number

```bash
openclaw clawgram --auth
```

If the custom OpenClaw cli command hangs, run the standalone authorization script directly:

```bash
node ~/.openclaw/extensions/clawgram/dist/clawgram-cli.js --auth
```

> **NOTES**: Starting with OpenClaw `2026.5.12`, hangs have been observed in some environments when running custom plugin cli commands through `openclaw <plugin command> ...`. If that happens, use the standalone command above. It runs the same authorization flow, but bypasses the custom cli entrypoint inside OpenClaw.

Follow the steps in the console

```bash
Starting Clawgram authorization...

Please enter your apiHash: EXAMPLE0123456789abcdef01234567

Since the plugin supports connecting multiple accounts, at this step the cli will ask you for the account ID, if you do not enter anything, the [default] key will be applied. You can also enter your own value.

```bash
Enter account id for config [default]: [2026-05-10T16:01:56.402] [INFO] - [connection closed]
[2026-05-10T16:02:02.096] [WARN] - [Disconnecting...]
[2026-05-10T16:02:02.103] [INFO] - [Disconnecting from x.x.x.x:80/TCPFull...]
```

In the next step, you must confirm or reject the automatic update of the openclaw.json configuration file. If you reject it or receive an error updating the file, the cli will display an openclaw.json configuration fragment that you must add manually.

The automatic config update keeps the rest of `openclaw.json` intact and only updates the `channels.clawgram` section for the selected account. A timestamped backup of the config file is created before any write attempt.

Update **yes**
```bash
Update OpenClaw config automatically? [y/N]: y

### 3. Restart OpenClaw gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

**What `--auth` writes is closed, on purpose.** The first config allows only the
account that authorised (`allowFrom: [<your id>]`), seeds no group entry, and
writes `readChats: []`. Until 2.21.1 it seeded `allowFrom: ["*"]` with an
enabled wildcard group, so a freshly authorised account answered any Telegram
user and read the history of every chat it belonged to. Widen both lists
deliberately; the flow prints who can reach the agent before it exits.

One restart after installation is enough. From 2.17.0 the plugin declares
`channels.clawgram` as a hot-reloadable prefix, so later edits under it —
`allowFrom`, `groups`, `readChats`, proxy — are picked up by the Gateway's
config watcher and restart only this channel (a few seconds of MTProto
reconnect), not the whole Gateway.


## Upgrading to 2.21.0

One config key changed meaning: **`allowFrom: []` now denies everyone.** It used
to resolve to the wildcard, so emptying the list to shut an account off opened it
to every Telegram user instead — the opposite of the request, and the opposite of
`readChats: []` and `manageChats: []`, which have always been documented as deny.

An absent key still means everyone, so an install that never set `allowFrom` is
unaffected; only an explicitly empty list changes. If you relied on `[]` to admit
everyone, write `["*"]`. The account logs `clawgram allowFrom is empty: no direct
message will be accepted` at start, so the new state is never silent.

This is a behaviour change to a config key and by the usual rule it would cost a
major bump. It ships as a minor deliberately: the plugin currently has one
operator, the value is almost certainly nowhere, and the warning makes the case
loud where it does occur.

### Mention fields 

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apiId` | number | required | Telegram API ID |
| `apiHash` | string | required | Telegram API hash |
| `sessionString` | string | `""` | Authenticated StringSession |
| `allowFrom` | string[] | `["*"]` | Allowed sender IDs/usernames for direct messages only. Three states: absent means everyone, `[]` denies everyone (a warning is logged at account start), a list allows those senders |
| `operatorIds` | string[] | — | Who receives core's operational telemetry in a DM (tool-failure warnings, fallback notices). They quote shell commands and secret-store paths, so they go **only** to these ids. Absent, empty or containing `*` means no operator is identified and the notices are dropped everywhere — they stay in the run diagnostics, the job's `lastError` and the gateway log. `allowFrom` is **not** a fallback (2.25.0; it was until then, which made every allowed sender an operator) |
| `groups` | object | `{}` | Allowed groups map keyed by explicit group id or `*` |
| `proxy` | object | unset | Optional SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy for this account — see [Proxy (SOCKS4/SOCKS5)](#proxy-socks4socks5) |
| `manageChats` | string[] | unset | Chats the assistant may **manage** — see [Chat management](#chat-management). Absent or empty = management off; `["*"]` = every chat |
| `sendChats` | string[] | unset | Chats the assistant may **send to** — `send`, `upload-file`, `react`, `edit` and core's own delivery path (`--deliver`, sub-agent announcements). Absent = every chat; `[]` = none. Phone-number targets are refused regardless (2.22.0; core delivery covered since 2.25.0) |
| `replyParseMode` | `"html"` \| `"markdown"` \| `"none"` | unset | Outbound format for replies, core-delivered text, captions and `send` calls that omit `parseMode` — see [Message formatting](#message-formatting) |
| `twoFaPassword` | string \| SecretRef | unset | The account's Telegram 2FA password; read only by `transferOwnership` |
| `readReceipts` | boolean | `true` | Mark a message read when the agent handles it. `false` leaves it unread in the account's own Telegram and shows the sender no receipt — see [A quiet inbox](#a-quiet-inbox) |
| `typingIndicator` | `"addressed"` \| `"never"` | `"addressed"` | When the sender sees "typing…" during a turn: only for a message that addressed the agent (every DM does), or never — see [A quiet inbox](#a-quiet-inbox) |
| `inboundFolders` | (string \| number)[] | unset | Only chats in these Telegram folders wake the agent — folder titles (emoji included) or numeric ids, evaluated with the folder's own rules and followed live. Narrows `allowFrom` and `groups`, never widens them; `read` is unaffected. Absent or `[]` = no folder filter — see [Only the chats in a folder](#only-the-chats-in-a-folder) |
| `ignoreBots` | boolean | `false` | Skip direct and group messages sent by a bot — notifications, or the owner's own control bot answering them. A sender that cannot be looked up counts as a person — see [Messages from bots](#messages-from-bots) |
| `reactionModel` | string | unset | Model ref or alias for the emoji pick on a silent mention. Unset = the agent's own model. Needs `plugins.entries.clawgram.llm.allowModelOverride: true` in the gateway config; without it the override is refused and the pick quietly falls back to the default model |

Group config fields:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enables or disables replies in the group |
| `groupPolicy` | `"open"` \| `"mention"` \| `"tag"` | `"mention"` | What wakes the agent here — see [What wakes the agent in a group](#what-wakes-the-agent-in-a-group) |
| `allowFrom` | string[] | `["*"]` | Allowed sender IDs/usernames inside that group. `[]` denies everyone, same as the account-level key |
| `tools` | object | unset | `{ allow?, alsoAllow?, deny? }` — tool policy for this group; see [Per-group tools, skills and system prompt](#per-group-tools-skills-and-system-prompt) |
| `toolsBySender` | object | unset | Per-sender tool policy inside this group, keys `id:<id>`, `username:<handle>`, `name:<display>` or `*` |
| `skills` | string[] | unset | Skill allowlist for this group; `[]` = no skills here, unset = the agent's skills |
| `systemPrompt` | string | unset | Trusted prompt block appended for messages from this group |

### What wakes the agent in a group

`groupPolicy` decides which messages start a turn at all. It is a ladder, widest
first, and the rung is chosen per group:

| Rung | Wakes on | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | every message in the chat | the agent works as a member of the team and an address may carry no name at all |
| `mention` | the name it answers to, an `@username`, or a reply to it | the default: the agent is a participant, not a fixture |
| `tag` | an `@username` or a reply to it — **never the name** | the name occurs in conversation constantly, as it does in a large community |

Two things are worth knowing before reaching for `open`:

- it spends a **full turn on every message**, chatter included. Whether words
  are owed is then the agent's decision, and most of the time the answer is no;
- the typing indicator is shown only for messages that actually addressed the
  agent. Under `open` the room would otherwise watch it "type" through
  conversations it is merely reading, with nothing following.

Emoji reactions are unaffected by the rung: the channel leaves one only where
the agent was genuinely addressed, so background reading stays unmarked.

### A quiet inbox

While the agent handles a message, the account marks it read and — if the
message addressed the agent, which a DM always does — shows the sender
"typing…" until the turn ends. That suits an agent that answers. It does not
suit a person's own account used as an inbox the agent reads silently: every
handled message disappears from the owner's unread list, and senders watch a
"typing…" that no reply follows.

```json
"accounts": {
  "default": {
    "readReceipts": false,
    "typingIndicator": "never"
  }
}
```

- `readReceipts: false` — nothing is marked read on the agent's behalf; the
  owner's Telegram shows the message as new, and so does the sender's.
- `typingIndicator: "never"` — no typing indicator in DMs or groups.
  `"addressed"` (the default) keeps today's rule.

The two are independent. Neither changes what the agent does — only what the
sender is shown while it does it. Replies the agent does send are still sent,
and in groups a silent mention can still leave a reaction unless
`reactionLevel` is `"off"`.

### Only the chats in a folder

An owner who reads one Telegram folder — say "❤️" — usually wants the agent
to read the same thing, not every chat the account is in. `inboundFolders`
names those folders; a message from any other chat is dropped before the
agent sees it.

```json
"accounts": {
  "default": {
    "allowFrom": ["*"],
    "groups": { "*": { "groupPolicy": "open", "allowFrom": ["*"] } },
    "inboundFolders": ["❤️"],
    "readReceipts": false,
    "typingIndicator": "never"
  }
}
```

- **Names.** A string is a folder title, matched exactly — emoji count, an
  invisible emoji variation selector (U+FE0F) does not; a number is a folder
  id. Several entries mean any of those folders. A name the account does not
  have admits nothing, and the log says so once, with the folders it does
  have (`clawgram inboundFolders names a folder this account does not have`).
- **Membership is Telegram's.** The folder's chosen and pinned chats are in;
  its excluded chats are out, whatever else is true of them. Chats Telegram
  adds by rule are in too: contacts, non-contacts, groups (basic and
  supergroups), channels and bots, as the folder ticks them — minus muted
  chats if it excludes muted ones (a message that mentions the account still
  gets through, as Telegram keeps such a chat in the folder) and minus
  archived chats if it excludes archived ones. "Exclude read" never drops a
  message: the chat has just received one, so it is unread. Shared folders
  (chat lists) contribute their chats.
- **Live.** The folders are read on first use, re-read when Telegram reports
  a folder change, and every ten minutes in case an update was missed.
  Moving a chat into the folder on the phone takes effect on its next
  message, without a restart.
- **Cost.** Chats listed in the folder cost nothing per message. A chat that
  gets in by rule may need one `getPeerDialogs` call for its mute and
  archive state (and, rarely, whether the sender is a contact), plus one
  `getNotifySettings` when the chat follows its type's default; both are
  cached for minutes and dropped when Telegram reports a change. At most
  four calls for a message, none once warm, each giving up after five
  seconds.
- **Fails closed.** A lookup that fails or times out skips the message and
  logs why. The skip itself is an info line,
  `clawgram skipping inbound outside inboundFolders`, with the chat, the
  message and the reason (`not-in-folder`, `excluded`, `muted`, `archived`,
  `lookup-failed`, `no-known-folder`, `folders-unavailable`).
- **Which folders, and is the filter finding them.** The `folders` action
  (gateway RPC only — `message.action` with `channel: "clawgram"`,
  `action: "folders"`) lists the account's folders: `id`, `title` (plain
  text), `emoticon` and `color` when set, `kind` (`filter`, or `chatlist`
  for a shared folder), how many chats are pinned, included and excluded,
  and which `categories` and `exclusions` are on — counts, never the chats
  themselves. With `inboundFolders` set, `inboundFolders.entries` says what
  each entry resolves to right now and `inboundFolders.unknown` lists the
  ones that name nothing (a renamed or deleted folder). Naming folders by
  id survives a rename; a title does not.

The filter narrows what the other gates admit and never widens it. A DM
still needs `allowFrom`; a group still needs an entry in `groups` and its own
`allowFrom` and `groupPolicy`. To let in exactly the folder's groups, give
`groups` a `"*"` entry as above — the folder then decides which groups that
is. The check runs after the gates that cost nothing and before anything
that asks Telegram about the sender or downloads an attachment. `read`,
`channel-list` and every other action are unaffected: the folder decides
what wakes the agent, not what it may look up when asked.

### Messages from bots

A person's own account receives a bot's messages like anyone else's:
notifications, and — when the owner also talks to the agent through a
control bot — every answer that bot sends them. Read as an inbox, each of
those is a turn spent on a message no person wrote. `ignoreBots: true` drops
them before the agent sees them, in DMs and groups alike.

```json
"accounts": {
  "default": {
    "ignoreBots": true
  }
}
```

- **Cost.** The check runs right after the gates that cost nothing and
  before the folder filter and any sender lookup. The sender GramJS already
  holds (from its entity cache) answers for free; without one, a single
  `getSender()` is made, bounded to 1.5 seconds.
- **Fails open for people.** A sender that cannot be looked up — the call
  fails, times out or returns nothing — is taken for a person and the
  message goes on to the other gates: losing a person's message is the worse
  mistake, and a bot that slips through costs one turn.
- **Logged.** Each skip is an info line, `clawgram skipping bot sender`, with
  the chat, the message and the sender id.

Default `false`: bots are treated like everyone else, as before. The setting
narrows what `allowFrom` and `groups` admit and never widens it; actions such
as `read` are unaffected.

### Per-group tools, skills and system prompt

Since 2.17.0 a group entry can narrow what the assistant does *in that chat*
without touching the agent as a whole. The keys mirror the bundled Telegram
channel's group config, and `*` works as the default group for them too.

```json
"groups": {
  "-1001234567890": {
    "groupPolicy": "mention",
    "systemPrompt": "This chat is project BRO. Other projects are out of scope here.",
    "skills": ["pm-standup", "pm-jira"],
    "tools": { "deny": ["browser", "cron"] },
    "toolsBySender": { "id:123456789": { "alsoAllow": ["cron"] } }
  }
}
```

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `systemPrompt` | Appended to the system prompt as a trusted block for turns from this group — the place to say what the chat is about and what stays out of it. |
| `skills` | Skill allowlist for turns from this group. Omit to inherit the agent's skills; `[]` means no skills in this chat. |
| `tools` / `toolsBySender` | Tool policy resolved by OpenClaw core for this group (`toolsBySender` wins for a matching sender). Keys use core's typed grammar: `id:`, `username:`, `name:`, `channel:clawgram:<id>` or `*`. |

**Limits — read before relying on `tools`.** The policy governs OpenClaw's
gateway tools (`message`, `sessions_*`, `cron`, `memory_*`, …). Under CLI
backends such as `claude-cli` those reach the model through the loopback MCP
tool list and are filtered per group; the backend's own native tools —
`exec`, `read`, `write`, `edit`, `apply_patch`, `process` — are governed by
the agent's exec policy, not by the group. If a chat must not have a shell at
all, bind it to a separate agent without one; the routing is core's, and the
peer id carries the account prefix this channel uses:

```json
"agents": {
  "list": [
    { "id": "main", "default": true, "workspace": "~/.openclaw/workspace" },
    {
      "id": "without-hands",
      "workspace": "~/.openclaw/workspace-without-hands",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5",
      "tools": {
        "deny": ["exec", "read", "write", "edit", "apply_patch", "process", "browser", "cron"],
        "message": { "actions": { "allow": ["send"] }, "crossContext": { "allowWithinProvider": false } }
      }
    }
  ]
},
"bindings": [
  { "agentId": "without-hands", "match": { "channel": "clawgram", "peer": { "kind": "group", "id": "default:-1001234567890" } } }
]
```

Nothing above changes for a group that does not set these keys.

### Message formatting

`replyParseMode` sets the outbound format for every path that does not name
one explicitly: replies, core-delivered text, media captions, and `send`
actions without a `parseMode` parameter. A per-call `parseMode` still wins.

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `"html"` | **Recommended for agents.** The text is rendered before sending (2.15.0): markdown (`**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``, ``` fences, `[text](url)`, `# headings`, `> quotes`, `~~strike~~`, `\|\|spoiler\|\|`) becomes Telegram entities, hand-written Telegram HTML (`<b>`, `<a href>`, `<code>`, …) passes through, structural HTML (`<ul>`, `<p>`, …) is dropped, and stray `<`, `>`, `&` arrive as literal text instead of vanishing into a failed tag. Markdown inside code is never converted. |
| `"markdown"` | GramJS's own markdown parser: `**`, `__`, `~~`, `` ` ``, ``` ``` ``` only — no links, no single-asterisk emphasis. |
| `"none"` | No parsing at all: the text is delivered exactly as typed. |
| unset | GramJS's historical default, which is its markdown parser — **not** plain text. Set `"none"` if you want plain. |

Agent-authored messages mix markdown and HTML freely, so `"html"` is the mode
that renders both. There is no reliable way to prompt a model out of writing
markdown; rendering it is the deterministic fix.

### Configuration variant for example

```json
{
  "channels": {

## Proxy (SOCKS4/SOCKS5)

### Why you may need it

GramJS speaks MTProto over **raw TCP sockets**. OpenClaw's managed proxy (`proxy.proxyUrl`) and the
standard `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables only cover HTTP and WebSocket traffic, so
they do **not** route the userbot's Telegram connection. On hosts where Telegram is blocked or
filtered, authorization and runtime work when the whole Gateway is launched through something like
`proxychains`, but a normal systemd restart of the Gateway then fails to connect.

Configure `proxy` on the account to make GramJS dial Telegram through a SOCKS proxy natively, with no
external wrapper and no changes to how the Gateway is started.

> **This is a SOCKS proxy, not a Telegram MTProxy.** MTProxy (the `secret`-based Telegram proxy
> protocol) is a different transport and is intentionally out of scope here.

### SOCKS5 example

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "clawgram": {
      "accounts": {
        "default": {
          "enabled": true,
          "apiId": 12345678,
          "apiHash": "apiHash",
          "sessionString": "sessionString",
          "proxy": {
            "ip": "proxy.example.com",
            "port": 1080,
            "socksType": 5,
            "username": "proxy-user",
            "password": "proxy-password",
            "timeout": 10
          },
          "allowFrom": [
            "*"
          ],
          "groups": {
            "*": {
              "enabled": true,
              "groupPolicy": "mention",
              "allowFrom": [
                "*"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### SOCKS4 example

SOCKS4 uses the same block with `socksType: 4`. SOCKS4 has no password authentication, so pass at most
`username`:

```json
"proxy": {
  "ip": "203.0.113.10",
  "port": 1081,
  "socksType": 4
}
```

### Proxy fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ip` | string | required | Proxy hostname or IP address |
| `port` | number | required | Proxy TCP port, `1`–`65535` |
| `socksType` | `4` \| `5` | required | `5` for SOCKS5, `4` for SOCKS4 |
| `username` | string | unset | Optional — only for proxies that require authentication |
| `password` | string | unset | Optional — only for proxies that require authentication |
| `timeout` | number | `5` | Optional connection timeout **in seconds** (GramJS default is `5`) |

Notes:

- `timeout` is expressed in **seconds**, not milliseconds — GramJS multiplies it by 1000 internally.
- `username` and `password` are optional. Omit both for an open proxy; blank strings are ignored.
- The proxy is configured **per account**, so one account can use SOCKS5, another SOCKS4, and another
  can connect directly:

```json
"accounts": {
  "default": {
    "apiId": 12345678,
    "apiHash": "apiHash",
    "sessionString": "sessionString",
    "proxy": { "ip": "proxy.example.com", "port": 1080, "socksType": 5 }
  },
  "second": {
    "apiId": 12345678,
    "apiHash": "apiHash",
    "sessionString": "sessionString",
    "proxy": { "ip": "203.0.113.10", "port": 1081, "socksType": 4 }
  },
  "third": {
    "apiId": 12345678,
    "apiHash": "apiHash",
    "sessionString": "sessionString"
  }
}
```

- Omitting `proxy` keeps the previous behavior exactly — a direct connection.
- If `proxy` is present but invalid (bad port, bad `socksType`, empty host), the account fails to start
  with an explicit error instead of silently falling back to a direct connection that would expose the
  host's real IP address to Telegram.
- On a successful connection the log line reports only `proxy: "socks5"` / `"socks4"` — never the host,
  port, or credentials.
- `openclaw clawgram --auth` only updates `apiId`, `apiHash` and `sessionString`, so an existing
  `proxy` block survives re-authorization. If you decline the automatic config update, the printed JSON
  fragment is a fresh-account template — merge it into your account instead of replacing the block, or
  you will drop the `proxy` section.

> **WARNING**: `password`, `apiHash` and `sessionString` are credentials. Never commit them to a
> repository, paste them into issues, or share config files containing them. Anyone with your
> `sessionString` has full access to your Telegram account.


## Slash commands

OpenClaw provides a robust set of native commands. Just like in a regular Telegram bot, slash commands are also available for a user Telegram account connected via the Telegram userbot plugin. Send the slash command in DM to the connected account.

Use commands like `/status`, `/reset`, `/new` and others.

You can read more about slash commands in the [OpenClaw official documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/slash-commands).



## Multi-Account

The plugin also supports adding multiple accounts. You can run the cli command many times

```bash
openclaw clawgram --auth
```


If the custom cli command hangs on your OpenClaw version, use the standalone command instead:

```bash
node ~/.openclaw/extensions/clawgram/dist/clawgram-cli.js --auth
```

And in the account ID step, enter a value other than the first [default] or your previously entered one.
account ID must be unique

```bash
Enter account id for config [default]: [2026-05-10T16:01:56.402] [INFO] - [connection closed]
[2026-05-10T16:02:02.096] [WARN] - [Disconnecting...]
[2026-05-10T16:02:02.103] [INFO] - [Disconnecting from x.x.x.x:80/TCPFull...]

          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Multi-agent routing

The Clawgram channel can also be used alongside the regular Telegram channel for configuring OpenClaw multi-agent routing. In that case, accounts connected via the Clawgram channel will have independent agents.

Here is an example of how to configure OpenClaw multi-agent routing using clawgram channel in parallel with main telegram channel.

You can read more about how to set up multi-agent routing in the official [OpenClaw documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/multi-agent)

List model
```json
 "list": [
      {
        "id": "main",
        "default": true,
        "workspace": "/root/.openclaw/workspace"
      },
      {
        "id": "second",
        "workspace": "/root/.openclaw/workspace-second",
      },
      {
        "id": "userbot-main",
        "workspace": "/root/.openclaw/workspace-userbot-main",
      },
      {
        "id": "userbot-second",
        "workspace": "/root/.openclaw/workspace-userbot-second",
      }
    ]
```

Bindings
```json
"bindings": [
    {
      "agentId": "main",
      "match": {
        "channel": "telegram",
        "accountId": "default"
      }
    },
    {
      "agentId": "second",
      "match": {
        "channel": "telegram",
        "accountId": "second"
      }
    },
    {
      "agentId": "userbot-main",
      "match": {
        "channel": "clawgram",
        "accountId": "default"
      }
    },
    {
      "agentId": "userbot-second",
      "match": {
        "channel": "clawgram",
        "accountId": "second"
      }
    }
  ]
```


> **NOTES**: Due to a known bug in the OpenClaw core, you may encounter an error in the logs: `EmbeddedAttemptSessionTakeoverError: session file changed while embedded prompt lock was released`. This error may primarily occur when communicating in group chats and not on all LLM models — only those that support tool calls. This error does not affect functionality, but it may cause a repeated request to the fallback model and excess token usage if you have one specified. To prevent this behavior, you can remove the fallback model in the openclaw.json configuration. To avoid affecting your main settings, override the model specifically for the clawgram channel in the agent list when configuring multi-agent routing — do not specify a fallback model for it.

```json
 "list": [
      {
        "id": "userbot-main",
        "workspace": "/root/.openclaw/workspace-userbot-main",
        "model": {
          "primary": "<some model>"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "userbot-second",
        "workspace": "/root/.openclaw/workspace-userbot-second",
        "model": {
          "primary": "<some model>"
        }
      }
    ]
```


## Actions and the names that reach them

Two grammars name the same actions. The **native** names (`read`, `participants`, `topics`,
`dialogs`, `chatInfo`, `fetch-media`, `createGroup`, …) are what the gateway RPC, the tests and
this README use. The agent's `message` tool, however, only dispatches names from **core's own
vocabulary** (`CHANNEL_MESSAGE_ACTION_NAMES`), so every action worth reaching from a prompt also
answers to core's nearest name. `src/actions.ts` is the single source of both lists
(`ACTION_ALIASES`, `CORE_VOCABULARY_SPELLINGS`); that core really knows each name is asserted
against the installed core in `test/core-action-synonyms.test.ts`, so a core release that drops
one fails the suite rather than the chat.

| Does | Native name | Callable from the `message` tool as | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| send text | `send` | `send` | `sendChats` |
| send a file | `upload-file` | `upload-file`, `sendAttachment` | `sendChats`, media roots |
| react to a message | `react` | `react` | `sendChats` |
| read history | `read` (also `list`) | `read` | `readChats` |
| fetch an attachment | `fetch-media` | `download-file` | `readChats` |
| list members | `participants` | `member-info` | `readChats` |
| list forum topics | `topics` | `thread-list` | `readChats` |
| list chats | `dialogs` | `channel-list` | `discoverChats` |
| describe a chat | `chatInfo` | `channel-info` (the chat arrives in `channelId`) | `readChats` |
| where the account was added | `joins` | — (gateway RPC only) | — |
| the account's folders, and what `inboundFolders` resolves to | `folders` | — (gateway RPC only) | — |
| chat management | see the table below | see the table below | `manageChats` |

Names outside core's vocabulary (`joins`, `folders`, `transferOwnership`, `inviteLink`) are reachable through
the gateway RPC only. A name core does not know fails as "requires a target" and "does not accept a
target" at once — there is no call that satisfies both, which is why this table exists.

## Chat management

Since 2.12.0 the assistant can assemble a chat, not only speak in it: create a supergroup, add and
remove members, promote and demote admins, hand the chat to a new owner, and issue invite links.
This exists because the plugin drives a personal MTProto account — Telegram's Bot API forbids most
of these to bots (a bot cannot create a group, cannot add an unwilling member, and cannot transfer
ownership at all).

**Off by default.** Every action below is gated by `accounts.*.manageChats`, and the default is the
exact opposite of `readChats`: absent or empty means *manage nothing*, a list of chat ids confines
management to those chats, `["*"]` allows every chat. A non-empty list also unlocks `createGroup`
(the chat being created is not in any list yet). All actions honour `dryRun`, and the gate is
checked before the dry-run answer, so a dry run exercises the same refusals a real call would hit.

| Action | Callable from the `message` tool as | Parameters | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `createGroup` | `channel-create` | `title`, `about?`, `users?` | Creates a **supergroup** (megagroup) — granular admin rights, bans and ownership transfer only exist there. Initial members are invited right after creation; who could not be added is returned in `missing` |
| `addMembers` | `addParticipant` | `chatId`, `users` | Adds to supergroups in one call, to basic groups one by one. Ids Telegram refused (privacy settings) come back in `missing` instead of failing the call |
| `removeMember` | `kick` | `chatId`, `user`, `ban?` | Soft kick by default — the person may be re-invited later. `ban: true` keeps them out until unbanned |
| `promoteAdmin` | `role-add` | `chatId`, `user`, `rank?`, `rights?` | Grants a deliberate default set (change info, delete messages, ban, invite, pin, calls, topics). `addAdmins` and `anonymous` stay **off** unless explicitly set in `rights` |
| `demoteAdmin` | `role-remove` | `chatId`, `user` | Strips every admin right |
| `transferOwnership` | — (gateway RPC only) | `chatId`, `user` | Supergroups only. Requires `twoFaPassword` (below); Telegram's own rules surface as errors — see the fine print |
| `inviteLink` | — (gateway RPC only) | `chatId`, `expireDate?`, `usageLimit?`, `title?`, `requestNeeded?` | The path for people whose privacy settings refuse a direct add. `expireDate` takes unix seconds or an ISO date |

User references in `users`/`user` are `@username` or a numeric Telegram id. A `@username` always
resolves; a bare numeric id only when the account has already seen the user (shared chat, dialog,
recent contact) — Telegram refuses to look up strangers by id.

**Ownership transfer fine print.** Telegram guards `transferOwnership` with an SRP proof of the
account's two-step-verification password, so the password has to be available to the runtime:
`accounts.*.twoFaPassword`, either a literal or a [SecretRef](#keeping-credentials-out-of-the-config-file).
It is read only by this action, exchanged for the SRP proof in-process, and never travels through
action parameters or logs. Telegram additionally refuses the transfer when 2FA was enabled less
than 7 days ago (`PASSWORD_TOO_FRESH_*`), when the session is younger than 24 hours
(`SESSION_TOO_FRESH_*`), or when the new owner is not yet an admin of the chat — promote them
first. These errors are surfaced as-is rather than retried.

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "clawgram": {
      "accounts": {
        "default": {
          "manageChats": [ "-1001234567890" ],
          "twoFaPassword": { "source": "file", "provider": "corp", "id": "/telegram/2fa-password" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Fetching attachments

Inbound attachments are read as they arrive: a photo or a voice note sent while the agent is being
addressed becomes text in the message body, and the bytes are dropped. History reads (`read`) carry
attachment *metadata* — kind, file name, size, duration — and fetch nothing. That leaves two things
out: an image posted in a chat before the agent was addressed, and any reuse of an image at all,
because the file the inbound path read is deleted the moment the reading ends.

`fetch-media` covers both. It takes one message and returns what is attached to it. The action
also answers to **`download-file`**, core's own name for it — see the note on naming below.

| Parameter | Aliases | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `chatId` | `chat` | The chat: `@username`, numeric id, `me`. **Not `target`** — core reserves that for actions in its own vocabulary and refuses it here |
| `messageId` | `id`, `message`, `msgId` | The id `read` reported for the message |
| `mode` | — | `both` (default), `read`, `file` |

Modes differ in what happens to the bytes:

- **`read`** — the attachment is turned into text (an image described, a voice note transcribed) and
  the file is deleted, exactly the inbound contract. No path is returned.
- **`file`** — the file is kept and its path returned, and no understanding model is called. This is
  what forwarding through `upload-file` or attaching to a ticket needs.
- **`both`** — the default: the reading *and* the path, from a single download.

The action is confined by `readChats`, the same scope that gates history and membership: a chat the
account may not read history from cannot be a source of bytes either. The action name also answers
to `fetchMedia`, `download-media`, `downloadMedia` and `getMedia`.

**On the two names.** Core keys its target policy by its own action vocabulary
(`CHANNEL_MESSAGE_ACTION_NAMES`), and an action outside it is treated as both *requiring* a target
and *not accepting* one — the same lookup returns `undefined` for the first check and defaults to
`"none"` for the second. A caller then gets `Action fetch-media requires a target.` without a
target and `Action fetch-media does not accept a target.` with one, whatever it tries.
`download-file` is in that vocabulary and maps to `"none"`, so the contradiction does not arise;
`fetch-media` is made usable by declaring `chatId` as its destination param
(`messageActionTargetAliases`). Both names run the same code.

What comes back is `ok: true` with `media` (the same metadata `read` reports), `understanding`
(`description` or `transcript`), and `text` and/or `filePath` per the mode. A fetch that yields
nothing is not an error — it says which nothing it was:

| `error` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `message-not-found` | No such message, or it was deleted |
| `no-media` | The message is text only |
| `unsupported-media` | An attachment this channel does not read — video, a spreadsheet, a sticker |
| `media-too-large` | Over the 25 MB inbound cap. Telegram reports no size for a compressed photo, so this is a document limit in practice |

A reading that fails while the download succeeded still returns `ok: true`, with `readError` beside
the path: the bytes are already there and can still be forwarded.

**Fetched files live under the OpenClaw state directory** (`$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/tmp/clawgram-fetched/`,
falling back to the system temp directory when that variable is unset), named after the chat and
message they came from, and are pruned an hour later by the next fetch. The directory is created
0700 and each file written 0600: these are private-chat images and voice notes, and until 2.21.1
they sat in a shared `/tmp` at 0644 for a day, readable by every local account on the host. Nothing
else removes them, and nothing sends them anywhere — putting a fetched file in a chat is an ordinary
`upload-file`, with whatever confirmation the deployment requires for that.

## Dependencies are pinned, and the lock ships

`installDependencies: true` tells OpenClaw to run an install in the plugin
directory, so what lands on the host is whatever the registry serves that day —
and the MTProto client sees `apiHash`, `sessionString`, the proxy credentials
and every message. Since 2.21.1 the two runtime dependencies are pinned to
exact versions and `npm-shrinkwrap.json` is part of the published tarball, so an
install reproduces the tree the tests ran against rather than resolving a caret
range. `npm ci --ignore-scripts` verifies it.

The transitive `ip-address` is held at 10.7.0 through `overrides`: everything at
or below 10.3.0 carries three advisories about SSRF and trust-boundary bypass,
and it sits under the SOCKS proxy path this channel uses.

## Security and privacy

This plugin holds credentials for a real Telegram account and handles private correspondence. What
that means in practice, and what the code does about it:

| Concern | Where it lives | What the plugin does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apiHash`, `sessionString` | `openclaw.json`, or a secret store | Written there by `--auth`. Never logged. Since 2.1.0 the session string is not printed after login either — only shown, behind an explicit warning, if you decline the automatic config write. Since 2.2.0 both accept a **SecretRef** instead of a literal, so the credential need not sit in the config file at all |
| Proxy password | `accounts.*.proxy.password`, or a secret store | Also accepts a SecretRef since 2.2.0. Marked `sensitive` in `uiHints`; diagnostics say `socks4`/`socks5` and nothing more. An invalid proxy fails the account rather than falling back to a direct connection, which would leak the host IP to Telegram |
| Message bodies | channel logs | **Not logged.** Outbound sends record recipient, ids and `textLength`. Until 2.1.0 the full outbound text was written to the channel log — if you ran 2.0.x, treat those journal entries as containing private correspondence |
| Read scope | `accounts.*.readChats` | History, membership and attachment fetches are confined to the listed chats. Absent means no restriction; an empty array denies everything. Telegram's own service chat (`777000`, where login codes arrive) is refused unconditionally, including under a wildcard |
| Send scope | `accounts.*.sendChats` | `send`, `upload-file`, `react` and core's delivery path are confined to the listed chats. Same shape as `readChats`: absent means no restriction, `[]` denies everything, `["*"]` allows every chat. **A phone number is refused whatever the list says** — messaging a raw number starts a conversation with someone who never contacted the account. Without the list, an injected turn can write to strangers from the owner's account or move a work chat's content into a DM one send at a time (2.22.0) |
| Manage scope | `accounts.*.manageChats` | Creating groups, changing membership, admin rights, ownership and invite links are confined to the listed chats — and **off entirely** when the key is absent or empty (opposite default to `readChats`, because these actions change chats rather than read them) |
| 2FA password | `accounts.*.twoFaPassword`, or a secret store | Read only by `transferOwnership`, exchanged for an SRP proof in-process. Accepts a SecretRef since 2.12.0; `sensitive` in `uiHints`; on the forbidden-log-keys list the static tests enforce |
| Who may talk to it | `allowFrom`, `groups.*.groupPolicy` | Direct-message senders and group behaviour are allowlisted; `mention` limits group replies to explicit mentions. **Write ids, not handles:** an `@username` entry is a claim about a handle, and a released handle can be taken by someone else, after which the entry admits a stranger. The account logs a warning at start-up for every handle entry (2.22.0) |

Two static tests (`test/no-secret-logging.test.ts`) fail the build if a message body or a credential
is ever added back to a log call, or if the auth flow prints the session string unprompted.

### Keeping credentials out of the config file

`apiHash`, `sessionString`, `proxy.username` and `proxy.password` accept a
[SecretRef](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/secrets) in place of a literal value:

References are resolved once per account at start-up. If one cannot be resolved the account fails to
start, naming the field but never the value — and the client refuses to be constructed while any
reference remains, so an unresolved secret can never travel to Telegram as a credential.

## Development

```bash
npm install          # install dependencies
npm run build        # run build script
npm test             # run the node:test suite (no Telegram connection required)
```

For local authorization testing during development, you can also run the standalone cli directly:

```bash
npm run clawgram-cli -- --auth
```

or

```bash
npm run clawgram-cli:auth
```

## Releases

Every push and pull request is built and tested on Node 22 and 24. Releases are cut by pushing a
`v<version>` tag: CI then builds from a clean checkout and publishes to npm with
[provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements), so each published tarball is
verifiably tied to the commit it was built from. The tag and `package.json` must agree or the job
refuses to publish.

Changes per version: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
