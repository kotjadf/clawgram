# Changelog

Notable changes to clawgram. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/);
versions follow [semver](https://semver.org/).

Releases are cut by pushing a `v<version>` tag — see the Publishing section in `CLAUDE.md`.
Versions from `0.1.0` to `1.0.2` predate the fork becoming a standalone product and are
recorded in `git log` only.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`readReceipts` and `typingIndicator` on the account**, for a person's own
  account that the agent reads as a silent inbox. Every handled message used
  to be marked read — gone from the owner's unread list — and every DM showed
  the sender "typing…" for the length of a turn that usually ended in
  silence. `readReceipts: false` marks nothing read; `typingIndicator:
  "never"` shows no indicator in DMs or groups. The defaults (`true`,
  `"addressed"`) keep the behaviour unchanged. `withTyping` takes a matching
  `read: false`.
- **`inboundFolders` on the account**: only chats in the named Telegram
  folders wake the agent, for an owner who reads one folder and wants the
  agent to read the same. Folders are named by title (emoji included) or id
  and evaluated with Telegram's own rules — chosen, pinned and excluded
  chats, the contacts / non-contacts / groups / channels / bots categories,
  and the exclude-muted and exclude-archived switches. They are read from
  the account on first use, followed through folder, notification and
  archive updates, and re-read every ten minutes. The filter applies to
  direct and group messages, narrows `allowFrom` and `groups` without ever
  widening them, runs before any sender lookup or attachment fetch, and
  fails closed: an unknown folder name admits nothing (logged once), a
  failed lookup skips the message. `read` and the other actions are
  unaffected. Absent or empty keeps the behaviour unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Loads and answers on OpenClaw 2026.8 and 2026.9.** 2026.8 removed the
  `plugin-sdk/channel-runtime` and `plugin-sdk/direct-dm` subpaths, so the
  plugin failed to load; `waitUntilAbort` now comes from
  `plugin-sdk/channel-outbound` and the two direct-DM helpers from
  `plugin-sdk/channel-inbound`, where core moved them unchanged. 2026.8 also
  stopped exporting `buildInboundReplyDispatchBase`: with the imports patched
  by hand the channel registered, and then every group turn threw inside the
  pipeline's catch. The group path now calls the runtime's
  `dispatchReplyWithBufferedBlockDispatcher` directly — all that helper ever
  repackaged. The `ChannelCapabilities` type comes from
  `plugin-sdk/channel-contract` instead of the removed root barrel.

### Changed

- **Minimum OpenClaw is `2026.5.27`** (was `2026.5.26`): the first release
  whose `channel-inbound` and `channel-outbound` carry all three helpers.

## [2.29.2] — 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **An inbound attachment no longer leaves a directory behind when its
  download throws or brings nothing.** The reader removes only a path it was
  handed; the temp directory was created before the download and left in
  `/tmp` on every other way out. Audit r3 V1-10, the inbound half — the
  `fetch-media` half was fixed in 2.29.1.
- **`clawgram-media-*` directories older than an hour are swept** from the
  media root and from the temp directory, at most once per ten minutes per
  root. Such a directory lives for one call; an old one was left by a crash
  or by a version before 2.29.1, and nothing removed it.

### Security

- **The shape check in `check-pii` covers 8 and 11 digits** and a supergroup
  id with up to 11 digits after `-100`: 8-digit ids belong to accounts from
  before 2016, 11 digits is where ids go next. A calendar date (`20260805`)
  and a size in bytes that is a whole number of MiB (`10485760`) count as
  synthetic. Audit r3 V1-07.

## [2.29.1] — 2026-09-23

### Security

- **No real person's Telegram identity in the package or the repository.**
  2.27.0–2.29.0 carried a third party's numeric id in `dist/` through a source
  comment; tests carried real handles, chat ids and chat titles from the
  deployment that motivated each fix. All replaced with synthetic values
  (`500000001`, `example_user`, `1000000002`). `scripts/check-pii.mjs` now runs
  first in `npm test` (and therefore in `prepublishOnly` and CI): it fails on a
  value from a denylist kept outside git (`CLAWGRAM_PII_DENYLIST`) and on any
  standalone 9–10 digit number that does not look synthetic. Audit r3 C2-01.
- **The check itself had four holes, closed before this release was tagged**
  (audit r3 V1-05…V1-09):
  - the denylist is matched without regard to case or a leading `@` — one
    more real handle, written as `username: "…"` in three tests, had passed
    it; those tests now use a synthetic handle. A denylisted `-100…` chat is
    also found by its bare channel id;
  - the "looks like a unix timestamp" exemption is gone: `15…`–`19…` is where
    current user and supergroup ids live. Synthetic now means few distinct
    digits, a round number, a counting run, or a listed fixture value; tests
    spell instants as `Date.UTC(…) / 1000`. `_` separators and BigInt `n` no
    longer hide a number;
  - it ran silently not at all — exit 0, no output — from a path with a space,
    Cyrillic, or through a symlink; the entry point now compares real paths;
  - it scans what is published: every tracked file plus the package `files`
    (the built `dist/`, `openclaw.plugin.json`), not only `src`, `test`,
    README and CHANGELOG;
  - CI and the release workflow hand it the denylist from the repository
    secret `CLAWGRAM_PII_DENYLIST` (the file's contents). Without the secret —
    a fork's pull request — only the shape check runs, with a warning in the
    log. A `CLAWGRAM_PII_DENYLIST` path that does not exist is an error.

### Fixed

- **A PDF read in `read` mode no longer stays on disk for good.** It kept its
  file for the agent's PDF tool, but in a private temp directory that only the
  non-PDF branch removed. It now lands in the shared fetch directory, which is
  pruned by age (r3 C2-02).
- **`fetch-media` in `read` mode leaves no private temp directory behind.**
  The directory was made before the download and removed only on success, so
  a message without media, an attachment this channel does not read, or a
  download that threw each left one on disk. Removal now sits in a `finally`
  (r3 V1-10).
- **A core notice sent as a media caption is dropped.** The telemetry filter
  covered the three text doors and not `outbound.sendMedia`; the file still
  goes, without the caption (r3 C0-11). The tests now cover the caption in
  both fields core may use — `caption` and `text`, which is the one core's
  own path fills — in a group, in a stranger's DM and in the operator's DM
  (r3 V1-11).
- A direct message whose turn ends in core's `⚠️ 🛠️ … failed` notice is now
  tested through the real inbound entrance: a stranger in `allowFrom` gets
  nothing, the named operator gets the notice (r3 V1-12, second half of C0-12).
- `sendChats` is dated 2.22.0 in the schema and README, not 2.18.0 (r3 C0-14).

### Changed

- One definition of a readable document: `fetchMediaUnderstanding` uses
  `isDocxDocument`/`isTextDocument` instead of a second extension list (r3 C2-03).
- `noUnusedLocals` is on; 29 unused imports removed. The log-content scan now
  covers every file in `src/` instead of a fixed list of nine, which the
  `actions-*.ts` split had outgrown (r3 C0-12, C0-15).
- Comments of the outbound gate speak of "this account", not "the owner":
  the channel runs on its own account (r3 C2-05).

## [2.29.0] — 2026-09-15

### Added

- **`edit` — rewriting a message the account already sent.** Until now a wrong
  answer could only be followed by a second message correcting it, leaving both
  standing in the chat. The name was never exotic: `edit` has always been in
  core's `CHANNEL_MESSAGE_ACTION_NAMES`, so the call reached this channel and
  was refused as an unsupported action. Accepted spellings are `edit`,
  `editMessage`, `edit-message` and `update`; the chat is named the same way
  every other action names it, and `messageId` says which message to rewrite.

  It is gated as an outbound act, not as a read: `sendChats` applies, `dryRun`
  rehearses without touching Telegram, and the `NO_REPLY` sentinel is refused
  as replacement text — worse there than in a send, because the original text
  is gone. Rendering mirrors `send` exactly, so an edited message keeps the
  formatting the send produced.

  Three things it deliberately does not do: take the message id from tool
  context (that id belongs to the message being answered — someone else's),
  prefix a reply address, or count as the turn having spoken. Telegram's own
  refusals reach the caller unchanged — `MESSAGE_AUTHOR_REQUIRED`,
  `MESSAGE_EDIT_TIME_EXPIRED`, `MESSAGE_NOT_MODIFIED` — because none of them is
  retryable and dressing them up would hide which one happened.

  `unsend` and `delete` are also in core's vocabulary and are deliberately not
  implemented: an edit is reversible in the sense that the message survives, a
  deletion is not.

## [2.28.1] — 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- **Requested documents are now usable, not merely visible in history.**
  `fetch-media` recognised only images and audio, so an agent could see a file
  in chat history but could not review it after the user said to do so. An
  explicitly named `.docx` is now downloaded into the existing private
  attachment directory and its `word/document.xml` is extracted locally;
  UTF-8 text documents (`.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, YAML, XML, HTML, RTF
  and similar) are returned as text; a PDF is retained as a private path for
  OpenClaw's configured PDF tool. Documents are still never fetched merely
  because they appeared in a group, and unsupported formats remain
  metadata-only. The DOCX parser accepts stored and deflated ZIP entries,
  rejects encrypted or malformed archives, and limits decompressed XML and
  plain-text input to 2 MB.

## [2.28.0] — 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- **A picture could be blocked by a leftover directory, and the agent was
  handed the errno.** The fetch directory had a fixed name in world-writable
  `/tmp`. When the deployment moved the agent to its own account
  (04.09.2026) the previous account's directory kept that name;
  `mkdir(..., { recursive: true })` is a no-op on an existing directory and
  the `chmod` that follows failed silently, so every fetch died with
  `EACCES: permission denied, open '/tmp/clawgram-fetched/…'`. From 05.09 to
  07.09 the agent could not read a single picture and reported to its owner
  that its "disk access was not restored" — the only reading an errno allows.
  The fallback root now carries the process uid (`/tmp/clawgram-<uid>`), so
  two accounts cannot collide, and `ensurePrivateDir` proves the directory is
  a directory, not a symlink, owned by this process and mode 0700 before
  anything is written — naming the cause when it is not.

### Security

- The old path was predictable and shared: any local user (this host also runs
  a deploy runner) could pre-create `/tmp/clawgram-fetched` and read every
  attachment the agent fetched, since the `chmod` that was supposed to close
  it failed silently on a directory it did not own. Ownership and mode are now
  verified rather than assumed, and a symlink on the path is refused instead of
  followed.

## [2.27.0] — 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **A numeric id is no longer an address.** `buildGroupReplyAddress` fell back
  to `senderId` when the sender had neither a handle nor a name, and the
  channel itself opened every reply with «<numeric id>, …». In a basic group
  GramJS attaches no sender profile to the message, and the profile lookup
  was gated on `allowFrom` naming an `@handle` (B5-04) — so in the owner's
  management chat that was every reply of the day (07.09.2026). Nothing
  known now means no greeting.
- **A sender who passed the gates is looked up once.** The B5-04 order stands —
  a foreign group, a blocked sender or a message the mention gate drops still
  costs no call — but a sender the agent will actually read, arriving without
  a name or handle, gets one `getEntity` (1.5 s timeout). When GramJS can
  resolve the entity, the greeting and `SenderName` carry the person; when it
  cannot (a basic-group update carries no users, and the in-memory entity
  cache is empty after a restart until something else fills it), the sender
  stays nameless — no greeting, `id:<n>` in the body — which is still not a
  number used as a name. Follow-up: on a miss in a group, one cached
  `getParticipants` and a retry.

### Changed

- **The agent reads `Адрес: текст` for a group message.** `BodyForAgent` was the
  bare text, so the turn could tell speakers apart only by the numeric id in
  metadata — and used it as an address. Core's own Telegram channel prefixes
  the sender for groups; clawgram now does the same (`agentFacingGroupBody`).
  The prefix is the very address the channel would prepend to the reply
  (`buildGroupReplyAddress`: handle first, then display name), so the model
  and the channel never greet the same person two different ways; with no
  address known it is `id:500`, marked so it is never mistaken for a name.
  `RawBody` and `CommandBody` are unchanged.

## [2.26.1] — 2026-09-07

### Changed

- **`handleAction` is a dispatcher again, not a 980-line closure.** The
  branches moved out unchanged: `actions-read.ts` (`read`, `fetch-media`,
  `participants`, `topics`, `dialogs`, `joins`, `chatInfo`),
  `actions-manage.ts` (the seven management actions) and `actions-send.ts`
  (`react`, `upload-file`, `send`), sharing one `ActionContext`; the
  per-account config readers went to `account-scopes.ts`. Sizes are not
  repeated here — `git show v2.26.0:src/channel.ts | wc -l` against
  `v2.26.1` says it. Behaviour is measured, not assumed: `npm run
  verify:actions` reports every recorded outcome identical (audit B5-13,
  part 3 — the part 2.26.0 deferred).

## [2.26.0] — 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **`-1001234:5` is the same chat to the scope gates as to the resolver.**
  `parseTargetWithThread` accepted the short topic spelling and the gates did
  not: `chatKeyCandidates` stripped `:topic:N` with a regex of its own, so a
  listed chat addressed as `-1001234:5` was refused as `not-allowed-chat`
  while `clawgram:-1001234:topic:5` passed (audit B5-08). One parser now,
  exported from `history.ts`; nine probe outcomes changed, all that spelling.
- **A local file is read through core's scoped reader when core gives one.**
  Core hands outbound calls `mediaReadFile` beside `mediaLocalRoots`; bundled
  channels read through it, clawgram opened the path itself as the gateway
  process and the reader was ignored — on paths core scopes with a reader
  and no roots, not scoped at all (audit B5-14). Both outbound paths
  (`upload-file`/`send` with a file, and `outbound.sendMedia`) now read
  through the reader and upload the bytes under the file's own name; without
  a reader the behaviour is unchanged.

### Changed

- **The behavioural probe behind the 2.22.0 split lives in the repository.**
  `scripts/verify/action-probe.cjs` drives every action spelling through the
  built channel on recording fake runtimes over three account configurations
  and compares each outcome with `action-probe.snapshot.json`; the 2.22.0
  claim of "354 outcomes, zero differences" could not be re-run by anyone
  but its author (audit D2-05). `npm run verify:actions`.
- **The unreachable pairing branch is gone.** `dmPolicy` has always been the
  literal `"open"`: a DM is admitted by `allowFrom` alone and clawgram offers
  no pairing challenge, so the branch that issued one could never run — but
  a reader took it for a barrier (audit B5-15). The policy is now stated as
  fixed where it is set, and the pairing controller is no longer created.
- **One account registry, cleared on stop.** `sendChats` and `operatorIds`
  were remembered in two module-level maps at account start and never
  forgotten; `account-registry.ts` holds one record per account, written on
  connect and dropped on disconnect. The send-scope refusal is spelled once
  (`describeSendRefusal`) for all four outbound doors — two of which logged a
  phone number the others hid (B5-09) — and the seven remaining copies of
  the runtime lookup use `requireRuntime` (audit D2-11).
- **One reply filter for the three doors an answer can leave through.**
  The group `deliver`, the direct `deliver` and the transcript fallback each
  carried a copy of "drop the silent token, drop core's telemetry", and the
  copies drifted (B5-01 was the price). `visibleReplyText` is the single
  copy; log lines keep their wording. `normalizeScopeList` replaces the four
  normalizers of `readChats`/`sendChats`/`manageChats`, two of which trimmed
  and two lowercased (audit B5-13, first two parts; extracting the action
  branches out of `channel.ts` is deferred — the diff would not be
  reviewable against the probe).
- **README names every action under the name the `message` tool reaches it
  by.** Eight of the ten core spellings (`thread-list`, `channel-list`,
  `channel-info`, `member-info`, `channel-create`, `addParticipant`,
  `role-add`, `role-remove`) appeared nowhere in it (audit B5-07): a table
  «Actions and the names that reach them» and a column in the management
  table, both pointing at `src/actions.ts` as the source.

## [2.25.0] — 2026-09-06

### Security

- **A direct reply no longer carries core's telemetry to whoever is in
  `allowFrom`.** The system-notice filter (A5-11) stood in
  `outbound.sendText` and in the group reply path; the ordinary reply to a
  DM goes a third way — core's dispatcher calling the DM `deliver` closure —
  and had no filter at all. A colleague whose turn crashed a tool received
  `⚠️ 🛠️ Bash failed: cat /opt/openclaw-secrets/…` in private. The DM path
  now applies the same filter with the account's operators (audit B5-01).
- **`outbound.sendText` honours `sendChats` and refuses phone numbers.** The
  scope guarded `handleAction` and `sendMedia`; core's delivery path
  (`--deliver`, sub-agent announcements) calls `sendText` directly and was
  the one outbound door left open (D2-01, A5-12).
- **`operatorIds` no longer defaults to `allowFrom`.** With the fallback,
  every allowed sender was an operator and received the notices above.
  Absent, empty or `*` now means "no operator named" and the notices are
  dropped everywhere; set `operatorIds` explicitly to keep them (D2-03).

### Fixed

- **Long messages are split, not dropped.** Core chunks only the replies it
  dispatches; a `send` from the message tool — how the guard scripts deliver
  reports — reached GramJS whole and failed with MESSAGE_TOO_LONG while the
  agent saw "✉️ Message failed". Text is split at paragraph, line or word
  boundaries under 4096 code points; a caption over 1024 goes as the file
  plus follow-up text (B5-03).
- **The inbound gate runs before the network.** Every message from every
  group the account sits in — configured or not — cost up to seven Telegram
  calls (sender profile, reply address, chat target) before the message was
  dropped as foreign. A group outside `groups` or disabled now ends before
  any call; the sender profile is fetched only when `allowFrom` names an
  `@handle` the message did not carry; reply targets are resolved only for
  senders who may reach the agent (B5-04, the rest of A5-06).

### Changed

- Refusal logs carry the shape of things, not the things: a blocked sender
  logs the size of `allowFrom` and whether it has a wildcard instead of the
  list itself (the owner's id among it, once per stranger's message); a
  refused phone-number target and the dialog-scan fallback log a target kind
  instead of the value (B5-09).
- 132 unused imports and one dead helper left behind by the 2.22–2.24 split
  are gone; `npx tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals` is clean (D2-09).
- The proxy verification scripts are tracked under `scripts/verify/` and
  runnable as `npm run verify:proxy` (the SOCKS simulation needs a local
  proxy and stays manual); they were only in the untracked `.claude/`
  before (B5-06).
- The tool hint no longer advertises phone/contact targets: send-scope has
  refused them since 2.18.0, and the hint taught a call that always ended in
  `not-allowed-chat` (D2-06).
- README gains the `sendChats` row that 2.18.0 forgot (D2-08).

### Unrecorded in 2.22.0

Nine commits landed between `v2.21.1` and the 2.22.0 bump without a
changelog entry (D2-07). For the record, 2.22.0 also brought: apiHash and
sessionString rendered masked in the manifest (`19729dd`); re-running
`--auth` keeps SecretRef migrations (`3aed20d`); the first config `--auth`
writes is closed — `allowFrom: [self]`, `readChats: []`, no wildcard group
(`a733296`, `55bb2f6`); the group reply path filters system notices and a DM
is not an operator console (`5007f73`); fetched media moved out of a shared
`/tmp` into a 0700 directory (`a4e3d32`); dependencies pinned with a
shipped lockfile and `ip-address` lifted out of three advisories
(`fb2ffe6`); `--auth` edits one account instead of rewriting the channels
block (`0815c6c`); `sendChats` outbound scope and phone-number refusal
(`15389ea`); per-message maps expire (`8e038fc`).

## [2.24.0] — 2026-09-06

### Changed

- **The inbound pipeline is its own module.** 856 lines inside
  `gateway.startAccount` carried every incoming message, and nothing tested
  them: `startAccount` builds its own Telegram client, so there was no seam to
  put a fake behind, and the action probe never enters that path.
  `channel.ts` is 1783 lines now, from 3274 where this began.

  The free variables were enumerated by the compiler rather than by reading:
  the body was temporarily extracted as a parameterless function and the
  "Cannot find name" errors are the list. That found nine; the build found
  three more that appear only as shorthand properties (`{ client }`).

  The body is moved verbatim — 803 non-blank lines, zero differences against
  the block it came from.

### Added

- The inbound path's first test. It covers what it covers and says so: six
  malformed event shapes do not throw (a throw there is an unhandled
  rejection on every incoming message), a normalizable event reaches sender
  resolution while an unnormalizable one touches nothing, and the twelve
  context names agree across the pipeline, its type and the caller.

  Not covered, deliberately: the allowlist gate and everything past sender
  resolution. The first version of that test asserted "answers nobody when
  allowFrom is empty" and passed — because the pipeline returned before
  reaching the gate. It passed for the wrong reason and was removed rather
  than kept as decoration.

## [2.23.0] — 2026-09-06

### Changed

- **The dispatcher stops retyping its own scaffold.** Six chat-management
  actions and five chat-shaped reads each spelled out the same sequence —
  resolve the account, check a scope, log, answer a dry run, call the
  runtime, log again, build the result — so a change to any of it, the
  dry-run contract for instance, was an eleven-place edit in the plugin's
  largest file. `runManage` and `runRead` hold it now, and each gate follows
  from the shape instead of being restated: `createGroup` checks that
  management is enabled at all rather than that a chat is in scope, because
  the chat does not exist yet, and that exception is written where it applies
  instead of hidden in a missing call. `requireRuntimeFor` replaces eleven
  copies of the same lookup.

- **Three modules out of `channel.ts`**: `actions.ts` (every accepted
  spelling of an action and what it resolves to), `attachments.ts` (an
  inbound attachment from download to text) and `outbound.ts` (the outbound
  contour). 3274 lines down to 3009 — worth saying plainly that the file is
  *larger in bytes* than the audit measured it, because the comments
  explaining the scaffolding cost more than the duplication they replaced.
  The dispatcher is better factored, not smaller.

  The inbound handler is deliberately untouched: no test drives it,
  `startAccount` constructs its client directly so there is no seam to put a
  fake behind, and splitting the one path that carries every incoming message
  with no net under it is a coin toss rather than a refactor.

- `no-secret-logging` now covers the new modules. It checked a hard-coded
  list of files, and moving the outbound code out would have left it green
  while guarding an empty space.

Behaviour is unchanged and was measured, not assumed: 354 outcomes — every
action spelling × three account configurations × dry-run and live — captured
from a build of the previous release and compared after each step, zero
differences every time, refusal messages included. That probe was not in the
repository; its successor is `scripts/verify/action-probe.cjs` with a tracked
snapshot (see Unreleased).

## [2.22.0] — 2026-09-06

### Changed

- **One table decides what an action name means.** The synonyms lived in
  `CORE_ACTION_SYNONYMS`, again in `MANAGE_ACTION_ALIASES`, and a third time
  as `action === "…" || …` chains in the dispatcher — and only the chains were
  consulted. A name could be added to a table and to the advertised list and
  still reach nothing, with the suite green: it dispatched only the native
  spellings. `canonicalAction` now resolves every spelling once, and both
  tables are derived from it. Reachability was compared against a build of the
  previous commit across 60 spellings: 54 dispatched before, 54 after, no
  differences, case-sensitivity unchanged.

- **A failing build now writes nothing.** `noEmitOnError` was off, so `tsc`
  emitted working JavaScript even when it failed and a fresh-looking `dist/`
  proved nothing — the repo's own CLAUDE.md warned about it in prose. The
  plugin also owns its `@types/node` (^22, matching the runtime) instead of
  borrowing v26 types transitively from `openclaw/node_modules`, and declares
  `engines.node`.

- Dead code removed: the CLI's "Specify one flag" branch was unreachable —
  by that point argv is non-empty and contains only known flags. Two constants
  with no readers outside their module lost their `export`.

### Fixed

- **The transcript fallback read the entire transcript on every turn that
  delivered nothing.** A live session's transcript grows without bound and the
  needed entry is always the last one, so only the final 256 KB is read now.
  The first line of that window is dropped: reading from an arbitrary offset
  lands mid-line, and mid-UTF-8-character.

- **`--auth` could corrupt the config when it had to INSERT rather than
  replace.** `findObjectEnd` returned the position *after* the closing brace,
  and the insert treated it as the brace itself, so a new property landed
  outside its object: a second account became a sibling of `accounts` inside
  `clawgram` — an account the runtime does not see at all — and a config
  without a `channels` block got the section written after the root's closing
  brace, leaving a file that is not JSON. Only the insert paths were affected,
  and an ordinary re-authorisation replaces, which is why it survived. The
  module had no tests; it has thirteen now, and these two cases are among
  them.

- **Two per-message maps never swept, and grew for the life of the process.**
  The address a group reply greets and the marker of the turn's own send were
  removed only when something read them back — and plenty are never read: a
  mention nobody answers, a send whose echo never comes. On a gateway that is
  restarted rarely by design that is a permanent slow leak. All three maps now
  share one `ExpiringMap`, bounded by time (swept on write, so a quiet process
  does no work) and by count (many distinct keys inside one TTL window is the
  case time cannot cover).

- **Every Telegram call re-resolved its peer, and an unseen target cost a scan
  of 200 dialogs.** `resolvePeer` is the entry of send, media, history,
  participants, topics, reactions, read marks and typing; writing to a person
  by id paid the scan on the send and again on the read mark and the typing
  indicator, over the SOCKS proxy. Peers are cached per client for ten minutes
  — short enough that a replaced session or a vanished peer is looked up again
  — and the dialog scan, which stays because `@username` without shared
  history resolves no other way, now says so in the log.

- **`toStringId` existed three times and had drifted.** Only the history copy
  refused `[object Object]` — a whole Peer passed where its id was meant — so
  the same peer was "found" by one path and "unknown" by another. One guarded
  copy now, imported everywhere. `parseMessageId` likewise: the two copies
  differed both in the check (`Number.isFinite` was only in one) and in what
  the error said. `readString`, `readNumber` and `isPlainObject` move into
  `src/util.ts`.

### Security

- **Telegram's service chat was readable under a prefixed spelling.** The
  unconditional refusal of `777000`, where login codes arrive, compared the raw
  target — so with `readChats: ["*"]`, `clawgram:777000` walked past it. All
  three scope gates (read, manage, send) now compare every spelling of a
  target: the bare id, core's `clawgram:`/`tg:` prefix, a `user:`/`group:`
  kind prefix and a `:topic:N` suffix. The same bug refused chats that *were*
  listed as soon as core addressed them with a prefix. A scope entry naming
  one topic still means that topic only.

- **`--auth` echoed the login code and the 2FA password into the terminal.**
  Both are account credentials, and a printed one stays in the scrollback, in
  a terminal session recording, and in the screenshot someone takes to report
  an error. They are read without echo now.

- **`allowFrom` entries written as `@username` are a claim about a handle**,
  and a released handle can be taken by someone else — after which the entry
  admits a stranger. Handles still work, but the account logs a warning at
  start-up (naming only how many, not who) and the docs say to write ids.

### Fixed

- **`outbound.sendMedia` had none of the guards its text sibling applies.**
  A caption carrying the silent token was delivered as a file, a group reply
  greeted nobody, and the send scope was never consulted. It now refuses a
  chat outside the scope, skips a silent caption and addresses the person the
  reply answers. Echo suppression is deliberately *not* applied to media: for
  text a duplicate costs a redundant message, for media a refusal costs the
  file itself.

- **A `tg-emoji` with no usable `emoji-id` broke the whole message.** The
  attribute was dropped and the bare tag emitted; GramJS's HTML parser turns
  that into a `MessageEntityCustomEmoji` with an undefined `documentId` and
  zero length — verified against the parser itself. The tag is now dropped
  and its text kept.

- **`topics` asked the server once and lost everything past the first page.**
  `limit` accepted up to 500, Telegram answers a page and waits for offsets,
  and `truncated` claimed nothing was missing. It paginates on `offsetTopic`
  now, stops when a page repeats an offset, and never returns more than the
  caller asked for.

### Added

- **`accounts.*.sendChats` — outbound scope.** Reading has had a declared
  scope since 2.x and management since 2.12, but sending had none: `send`,
  `upload-file`, `react` and core's delivery path resolved whatever target
  the caller named and delivered it. The account is a person's own Telegram
  account, so an injected turn could message strangers under the owner's
  name, or carry a work chat's content into an attacker's DM one send at a
  time. The list has the same shape as `readChats`: absent means no
  restriction, `[]` denies everything, `["*"]` allows every chat.

  An absent list still allows sending, deliberately: flipping the default
  would silence every existing deployment on upgrade, including scheduled
  digests that write to an id nobody is talking to right now. A deployment
  that wants the boundary writes `sendChats`, and then it is a boundary in
  code rather than a sentence in a prompt a model can be argued out of.

### Security

- **A phone number is refused as an outbound target in every configuration**,
  wildcard included. Messaging a raw number starts a conversation with
  someone who never interacted with the account and hands them the account's
  identity; an assistant has no reason to do it, and the address book is not
  the model's to walk.

## [2.21.1] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- **The tool hints never said how `read` names its chat, and the neighbouring
  hints taught the wrong answer.** `read` is in core's own vocabulary, so core
  resolves the destination itself and reads only `to`/`target`; `chatId` is
  silently ignored and the call comes back as `Action read requires a target`.
  The chat-shaped reads beside it — `thread-list`, `channel-info`,
  `member-info` — are the exact opposite, because core does not know them and
  the plugin parses `chatId` itself. Nothing stated that asymmetry, so agents
  generalised from the closest hint and addressed `read` with `chatId`.

  Measured on the live server on 2026-09-04: `read` with `chatId` refused,
  the same call with `target` returned messages. The cost was 745 refused
  reads in the week before, and 32 more in a single cron run after.

  The hint now names `target` for `read` explicitly, says `chatId` is wrong
  there, and points at the asymmetry so the neighbouring convention stops
  reading like a contradiction. A test asserts the hint keeps saying it.

## [2.21.0] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- **`allowFrom: []` now denies everyone instead of admitting everyone.** An
  empty list, an empty string, or a list of blanks resolved to the wildcard, so
  an operator who emptied the list to shut an account off opened it to every
  Telegram user — while `readChats: []` and `manageChats: []` have always been
  documented as deny. An absent key still means everyone, so a fresh install is
  unaffected; only an explicitly empty list changes meaning.

  **Migration:** if you relied on `allowFrom: []` to accept everyone, write
  `["*"]`. The account logs `clawgram allowFrom is empty: no direct message
  will be accepted` at start, so the new state is never silent.

### Fixed

- **Inbound and outbound message bodies were written to the channel log.** The
  group mention gate logged the whole incoming message as a shorthand `text`
  property, the group deliver path logged `payloadText`, and the transcript
  fallback logged `fallbackText` — while `README.md` promised message bodies are
  not logged and a static test was supposed to enforce it. All three now record
  a length.

  The test missed them twice over. Its call-site pattern stopped at the second
  optional link, so `log?.info?.(` — the shape most of `channel.ts` uses — never
  matched: 42 of the file's 87 log calls were never examined. And it read only
  `key: value` pairs, so the shorthand `text,` was invisible even in the calls it
  did examine. It now matches both optional links, reads shorthand properties,
  and rejects any key ending in `text` unless it is a predicate (`hasText`), so
  a future rename cannot walk past it again.

- **`--auth` widened the permissions of the config it rewrote.** The atomic
  write and the backup copy both used `fs.writeFile` with no mode, and
  `writeFile`'s mode is masked by the umask in any case, so a config the owner
  had locked to `0600` came back `0644` with `apiHash` and `sessionString` in
  plaintext — and the backup, which is never cleaned up, was created `0644`
  from the start. Both now read the current file's mode and `chmod` the temp
  file before the rename; a config that cannot be stat'ed falls back to `0600`.
  `update-config.ts` had no tests at all, so four came with the fix.

- **`read chatId=777000` handed the agent its own Telegram login codes.** The
  inbound path has dropped Telegram's service chat since the beginning, but the
  read gate had no equivalent: with `readChats` absent — the default `--auth`
  writes — or holding `*`, every read action (`read`, `fetch-media`,
  `participants`, `topics`, `chatInfo`) could pull the current login code, which
  is an account takeover rather than a privacy lapse. `isChatReadable` now
  refuses that chat unconditionally, so no config entry can enable it, and the
  id itself moved to `constants.ts` so both paths name the same thing.

- **A dry-run `send` changed what the real send did.** The `dryRun` return sat
  after two stateful steps: `consumeGroupReplyAddress` deleted the remembered
  "@name" for the message being answered, so the rehearsal ate the greeting and
  the message that actually went out was unaddressed; and the duplicate-reply
  guard could short-circuit the call, answering `suppressedDuplicate` where the
  caller had asked for `dryRun`. A dry run now peeks at the address instead of
  consuming it, and a suppression carries `dryRun: true` alongside, so the
  rehearsal reports what would happen without being what happens.

- **A dead session leaked a GramJS update loop on every channel restart.**
  `start()` calls `connect()` — which starts the loop unconditionally — before
  `checkAuthorization()`, so a revoked or expired session threw with `started`
  still false, and `stop()` returned early on exactly that flag: the connected
  client kept retrying and logging `Error: TIMEOUT` forever. This is the 2.17.1
  leak reached through the failure path, and it surfaces precisely when
  restarts are being attempted against a session that no longer works.
  `start()` now destroys the client on any failure, and `stop()` keys on
  whether the client ever connected rather than on whether it fully started.
  Stopping a client that never connected still touches nothing, and stopping
  twice still destroys once.

- **A `send` naming another chat with `chatId` went to the current chat.** The
  send path read `to`/`target` only and then fell back to the chat the turn
  came from, while the read actions — and this plugin's own tool hints — name a
  chat with `chatId`. The same gap hit `chatInfo` from the other side: core
  dispatches it as `channel-info` with target mode `channelId`, a key no parser
  here read, so the call was answered about the current chat instead of the one
  it named.

  Every parser now goes through one resolver that accepts `chatId`,
  `channelId`, `target`, `to` and `chat`, prefers a named chat over the current
  one, and refuses outright when two keys name two different chats rather than
  picking by key order. Numeric ids are still refused rather than coerced.

- **A channel-level `allowFrom` or `groups` validated and then did nothing.**
  The manifest declares both per account and at the channel level, but only the
  account copies were read: an allowlist written one level up passed validation
  and admitted everyone. The config was also read twice by two independent
  paths, `resolveAccount` and the inbound handler, which could therefore
  disagree about the same file. One resolver serves both now — the account's
  own value wins (a deliberate `[]` included), the channel level is the default
  beneath it, and groups merge per key instead of replacing wholesale.

- **A screenshot naming the agent woke her up.** The group mention gate read
  the whole assembled body, attachment reading included, so a vision model's
  description of somebody else's content counted as an address: a screenshot of
  a chat where a third party wrote `@tina_bot`, or a photo of a poster carrying
  the name, walked straight through `groupPolicy: "mention"` and `"tag"`.

  A transcript is different in kind — it is the sender speaking, so "Тина,
  посмотри" said aloud must keep working, and it does. Only descriptions are
  now excluded from what may count as being addressed; the body handed to the
  agent is unchanged, and a caption on the same image addresses her as before.

- **`--auth` logged in without the account's proxy.** The interactive flow
  built its own `TelegramClient` with a hand-rolled options object and read no
  proxy at all, so the login handshake — phone number, code, 2FA password —
  went out from the host's real IP even on a deployment whose whole point is
  that Telegram never sees it. It now uses the same `buildTelegramClientOptions`
  the channel does, which also means an unresolved SecretRef refuses the login
  rather than falling back to a direct connection. The scheme is printed,
  nothing else.

- **An outbound file was never checked against the agent's media roots.** Core
  scopes every action to the roots the agent may read and bundled channels
  enforce them, but this channel took `filePath`, `path`, `media` or `mediaUrl`
  verbatim and handed it to GramJS `sendFile`. An agent talked into naming the
  secret store, or the config holding `sessionString`, uploaded it to whatever
  peer it chose. `upload-file`, `send --media` and `outbound.sendMedia` now
  refuse a local path outside the declared roots, resolving symlinks first. A
  call core did not scope — the gateway RPC, the voice contour — is unchanged,
  because refusing those would break sending rather than narrow it.

- **A stranger's photo or voice note was downloaded and modelled before the
  sender was checked.** Reading an inbound attachment fetches up to 25 MB and
  then spends a transcription or vision call on it, and that ran for every
  attachment from anyone in any group the account sits in — `allowFrom`, the
  group config and the mention gate were all consulted afterwards. Anyone who
  could reach the account could spend the owner's model budget at will.

  None of the checks deciding whether a sender may reach the agent depend on
  the message text, so they now run first and the fetch is skipped entirely for
  a sender who would have been refused anyway. The scopes are resolved once and
  reused by the branches below, which previously recomputed them.

## [2.20.1] — 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- **A plain reply reached the agent as a bare parent id.** Telegram does not
  put the parent's text into a reply; only a highlighted fragment
  (`quoteText`) travels with it, and most replies have none. The channel
  forwarded the highlight (2.4.0) and nothing else, while core renders
  `[Replying to: …]` from `ReplyToQuoteText` *or* `ReplyToBody` — so every
  reply without a highlight arrived as "reply to #1011" with nothing behind
  it. The case that exposed it (2026-09-02): the owner answered, in a DM, the
  agent's own notice about an unknown sender; the notice had been sent from
  another session and DMs are outside `readChats`, so the agent could not
  recover the text by any route and asked the owner what he meant.

  Both inbound sites now fetch the parent once (`getReplyMessage`, which the
  group path was already calling for the reply-to-self gate and discarding)
  and pass `ReplyToBody` and `ReplyToSender`. Core renders the body inline
  as `[Replying to: "…"]`; the sender label (the agent's own name for her
  own messages, otherwise display name, `@username`, then id) is passed for
  the consumers that read it, but the inline Telegram rendering in core
  2026.7.1 does not show it. A parent that cannot be fetched degrades to
  today's behaviour — no context — never to a dropped message. Highlights
  keep precedence in core, so quoted replies are unchanged.

## [2.20.0] — 2026-09-01

### Changed

- **Core's operational chatter no longer reaches group chats.** Three days in
  a row the owner's work group received the assistant's internal telemetry as
  ordinary messages: `⚠️ 🛠️ Bash failed: …` with a full shell command
  including secret-store paths (2026-08-30), a bare `⚠️ ✉️ Message failed`
  (08-31), `⚠️ 🛠️ Exec failed: …` appended after a perfectly good reply
  (08-31), plus `↪️ Model Fallback: …` notices during the auth outage. Each
  had a different root cause; the shared defect is that operator telemetry was
  delivered to an audience it was never for.

  `sendText` now classifies core's notices by their exact machine-built
  prefixes and drops them for group and channel targets, logging the class and
  length — never the text. DMs keep the telemetry: there the reader is the
  person running the agent. Detection is prefix-exact, so the assistant
  discussing a failure in its own words is untouched.

  Trade-off, stated plainly: a group turn that dies now dies silently for the
  room. The failure stays in the run diagnostics, the cron job's `lastError`
  and the gateway log — where the operator reads it — but the person who asked
  sees nothing rather than a broken-looking status line.

## [2.19.4] — 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- **The tool advertised actions the agent could not call, and one of them
  broke a live reply.** 2.19.3 gave `topics`, `dialogs`, `chatInfo` and
  `participants` names core knows, but kept offering the descriptive spellings
  beside them — and a hint even said clawgram "also answers to `chatInfo`".
  From the agent's `message` tool it does not: an action outside
  `CHANNEL_MESSAGE_ACTION_NAMES` is both "requires a target" and "does not
  accept a target", and no call satisfies both.

  On 2026-08-31 the `meeting-watch` job took the offer, called `chatInfo`, got
  both halves of the contradiction, and the turn ended as `✉️ Message failed`
  in the owner's chat.

  The tool now offers only names core can dispatch. The descriptive spellings
  still work in `handleAction`, so gateway RPC and existing skills are
  unaffected — RPC never consults the advertised list. Hints and capability
  lines name the callable spelling only.

### Added

- **Chat management is callable from the tool for the first time.**
  `createGroup`, `addMembers`, `promoteAdmin` and `demoteAdmin` had been
  advertised since 2.12.0 under names core does not know, so every attempt
  failed the same way; they now answer to `channel-create`, `addParticipant`,
  `role-add` and `role-remove`. `removeMember` already had `kick`.
  `transferOwnership`, `inviteLink` and `joins` have no counterpart in core's
  vocabulary and stay gateway-only rather than being offered as traps.

- A test that reads `CHANNEL_MESSAGE_ACTION_NAMES` out of the installed core
  and asserts every advertised action appears in it. The rule this repo kept
  relearning — advertised implies reachable — is now checked against core
  itself rather than a copy that can drift.

## [2.19.3] — 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- **`topics`, `dialogs`, `chatInfo` and `participants` were unreachable from the
  agent's `message` tool.** 2.19.2 tried to fix this by declaring `chatId`
  through `messageActionTargetAliases`, and that does nothing: core resolves a
  channel with `getBootstrapChannelPlugin`, which only ever returns a bundled
  channel, so a plugin channel's declaration is never read. What actually
  carried `fetch-media` through in 2.19.1 was its second name, `download-file`
  — a name core already has, mapped to target mode `"none"`.

  Each of the four now answers to a core name too: `thread-list` for `topics`,
  `channel-list` for `dialogs`, `channel-info` for `chatInfo`, `member-info` for
  `participants`. Measured on the live server on 2026-08-30 — `thread-list`
  reached `handleAction` from the same caller that `topics` could not.

  `joins` has no core equivalent and stays reachable only through the gateway
  RPC, which skips the target policy altogether. The native spellings keep
  working there too, so existing skills and cron prompts are unaffected.

## [2.19.2] — 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- **`topics` was unreachable from the agent tool, and so was every other
  chat-scoped action outside core's vocabulary.** 2.19.1 fixed this for
  `fetch-media` and stopped there. The same contradiction — "requires a target"
  without one, "does not accept a target" with one — still swallowed `topics`,
  `participants`, `chatInfo` and the chat-management actions, because core keys
  its target policy by `CHANNEL_MESSAGE_ACTION_NAMES` and none of those names
  are in it.

  Measured on the live server on 2026-08-30: the `bro-feedback-watch` cron job
  is built on `topics`, and the agent tried `target`, `chatId`, `groupId` and
  the `clawgram:`-prefixed form, got one half of the contradiction each time,
  and abandoned the run — every fifteen minutes.

  `messageActionTargetAliases` now declares `chatId` for every action whose
  handler already reads it, not just the two media ones, and a test asserts the
  list stays in step with the actions the tool advertises. `dialogs` and `joins`
  take no chat at all and remain unreachable: core gives a channel no way to
  declare an action targetless, so an unknown action always requires a target.

## [2.19.1] — 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **`fetch-media` was unreachable from the agent tool.** 2.19.0 advertised the
  action and implemented it; core refused every call before it arrived. Core
  keys its target policy by its own action vocabulary, and an action outside
  that vocabulary is simultaneously "requires a target"
  (`MESSAGE_ACTION_TARGET_MODE[action] !== "none"` is true for `undefined`) and
  "does not accept a target" (the same lookup defaults to `"none"` when a
  target is passed). Measured on a live server on 2026-08-24: the agent tried
  `chatId`, `target`, `channelId` and every combination, and got `Action
  fetch-media requires a target.` without one and `Action fetch-media does not
  accept a target.` with one.

  Two changes, both needed. The action now also answers to `download-file` —
  core's own name for exactly this, mapped to target mode `"none"`, so the
  contradiction does not arise. And the channel declares `chatId` as the
  destination param for both names through `messageActionTargetAliases`, the
  hook core consults for actions it does not know, so a call that names the
  chat is no longer refused as targetless.

  The chat is named by `chatId`, never `target`: core throws on `target` for
  any action outside its vocabulary. The tool hint now says so.

## [2.19.0] — 2026-08-24

### Added

- **`fetch-media` — the attachment on a message, on demand.** Inbound
  attachments are read as they arrive and the bytes are then dropped; history
  reads report that a photo exists and fetch nothing. Two things fell between
  those: an image posted before the agent was addressed (in a chat it reads,
  by a policy that only wakes it on a mention, which is most work chats), and
  any reuse at all — the file the inbound path read is deleted the moment the
  reading ends, so an image could be described once and never forwarded,
  attached, or looked at again.

  The action takes a chat and a message id and returns what is attached:
  `mode: "read"` gives the reading and deletes the file (the inbound
  contract), `"file"` keeps the file and skips the model call, `"both"` — the
  default — returns the reading and the path from one download. Images are
  described and voice notes transcribed through the same
  `runtime.mediaUnderstanding` call the inbound path makes, now shared rather
  than duplicated, so an image read on arrival and the same image read on
  request cannot drift apart.

  Confined by `readChats`, like history and membership: a chat whose history
  the account may not read cannot become a source of bytes either. A fetch
  that yields nothing says which nothing it was — `message-not-found`,
  `no-media`, `unsupported-media`, `media-too-large` — because answering
  "could not fetch" to all four is how "she ignored the picture" starts. A
  reading that fails after a successful download still returns the path with
  `readError` beside it: the bytes are already here.

  Fetched files live in `clawgram-fetched/` under the system temp directory,
  named after the chat and message they came from, and are pruned after 24
  hours by the next fetch — nothing else would ever remove them. `read` mode
  downloads into a directory of its own instead: the shared name is keyed by
  chat and message, so deleting it would pull the file out from under an
  earlier `both` fetch that had already handed the path to the caller.

## [2.18.0] — 2026-08-17

### Added

- **`groupPolicy: "tag"`.** A third rung below `mention`: only an explicit
  `@username` or a reply wakes the agent, never the name it answers to. It
  exists for chats where the name is conversation rather than address —
  measured in the owner's 1041-person community chat over 15–17.08.2026,
  exactly one message tagged the account while the name itself turned up
  routinely. `mention` remains the default and anything unrecognised falls back
  to it: a typo must not silently change what a chat costs.

- **`accounts.<id>.reactionModel`.** The emoji pick on a silent mention is the
  only model call this channel makes on its own, and it ran on the agent's own
  head. It can now be pointed at a small model. Core refuses a plugin's model
  override unless `plugins.entries.clawgram.llm.allowModelOverride` is set, and
  the refusal is a throw this feature swallows — so a refused override retries
  on the default model and logs `modelFellBack`, rather than turning the
  reaction into silence nobody can explain.

### Fixed

- **The typing indicator no longer promises an answer that is not coming.**
  It is now shown only for messages that actually addressed the agent. Under
  `groupPolicy: "open"` every message starts a turn and most of them end in
  silence: on 2026-08-17 the owner's management chat watched «Тина печатает…»
  for 20–26 seconds on four consecutive messages that were never addressed to
  her, each followed by nothing. The read receipt is unchanged — reading is
  what she did, typing was a promise she did not owe. Chats on `mention` and
  `tag` are unaffected, since there a turn only starts when addressed.


## [2.17.1] — 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- **Every channel restart leaked a GramJS update loop.** `stop()` called
  `client.disconnect()`, which drops the connection but leaves the update loop
  running: GramJS spins it as `while (!client._destroyed)` and only `destroy()`
  sets that flag. Each leaked loop keeps retrying and printing `Error: TIMEOUT`
  for the lifetime of the process.

  The leak is older than this release, but it was nearly unreachable: a write
  under `channels.clawgram` used to restart the whole Gateway, which took the
  loops with it. 2.17.0 declared the prefix hot-reloadable, so a routine
  roster/allowlist write now restarts only the channel — and the leak became a
  per-write cost. Measured on a live server on 2026-08-15: zero timeouts on the
  two preceding days, ~3/min after two channel restarts, ~4.5/min after a third.
  `stop()` now calls `destroy()`; losing the event handlers it clears is
  correct, because the manager is discarded on stop.

## [2.17.0] — 2026-08-15

### Added

- **Per-group `tools`, `toolsBySender`, `skills` and `systemPrompt`.** A
  chat's scope could only be held by the agent's prompt: the config knew
  which groups the assistant answers in, not what it may do in each. The four
  keys are the bundled Telegram channel's group vocabulary and are opt-in — a
  group without them behaves exactly as before. `systemPrompt` reaches core as
  a trusted block, `skills` as the turn's skill allowlist (`[]` = no skills
  here), `tools`/`toolsBySender` are resolved by core through a new
  `groups.resolveToolPolicy` hook.

  The hook exists for one reason: core derives group ids from the session key
  and hands the channel the scoped peer id `<accountId>:<chatId>`, while
  `groups` is keyed by the bare chat id — without the translation the policy
  would look up `groups["default:-100…"]` and silently never apply. Under CLI
  backends the policy filters gateway tools (loopback MCP), not the backend's
  own exec/read/write; the README says so and shows the bindings recipe for a
  chat that must not have a shell.

### Changed

- **Config edits under `channels.clawgram` no longer restart the whole
  Gateway.** Core plans hot reloads from `plugin.reload.configPrefixes`; a
  changed path that matches no rule restarts the Gateway (SIGUSR1, all runs
  aborted). Measured on 2026-08-13 21:50:52 UTC: one write to
  `channels.clawgram.accounts.default.groups` did exactly that. The plugin
  now declares the prefix, so the same edit restarts only this channel.

## [2.16.1] — 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **A person with more than one Telegram handle came back without any.**
  Telegram moved handles into a `usernames[]` array once an account could hold
  several — multiple handles, or a collectible one — and for such an account
  the legacy `username` field arrives EMPTY. Three places read that raw field:
  the participant list, `chatInfo`, and the inbound sender.

  The visible damage was in generated tables: the owner of one deployment
  appeared as "(без тэга)" beside a bare numeric id, in every chat, while
  everyone else carried a handle — 1 of 23, 1 of 9, 1 of 7, 1 of 3. The quiet
  damage is worse: an `allowFrom` entry written as `@handle` never matches such
  a person, and no error says so.

  All three now go through `resolveActiveUsername`, which prefers the plain
  field and otherwise takes the active entry out of `usernames[]`. The helper
  already existed and was used for exactly one thing — the account's own handle,
  so that mention detection would work.

## [2.16.0] — 2026-08-14

### Added

- **`dialogs` — which chats this account is actually in.** On 2026-08-13 the
  owner added the account to two chats a minute apart. The 7-person basic group
  was picked up; the 1039-member forum supergroup was not, and nothing anywhere
  recorded that the account had joined it. Every message from it was dropped as
  `skipping group not present in groups config` while the onboarding pipeline —
  join service message → journal → roster → allowlists — waited for a service
  message Telegram never sent, because large supergroups do not emit one.

  Membership is now answerable directly instead of being inferred from an event
  that may not arrive. The action reports id, title, type and `isForum` for
  group chats only: direct conversations are dropped before the caller sees the
  list, and no message content is read. It is the one read that deliberately
  reaches past `readChats` — its job is to find chats that are not in it yet —
  so it has its own switch, `discoverChats`, and stays off until an account
  sets it.

- **`topics` — a forum's topics by name.** `chatInfo` could say a chat *was* a
  forum and stop there. A topic id could only be lifted off an inbound message,
  so a topic nobody had posted in yet was unreachable, and one named in words
  ("the Визитка topic") could not be turned into an id at all. The action lists
  id, title, last message and the closed/hidden/pinned flags, with an optional
  `query` narrowing by title. Gated by `readChats`: a topic list describes what
  a chat is working on.

- **`participants` takes `filter: "admins"`** (also `admins: true`), asking
  Telegram with `ChannelParticipantsAdmins`. "Answer only the admins of this
  chat" is a standing rule, and a rule needs a list that can be re-read rather
  than one copied out by hand once.

### Fixed

- **`read` ignored the forum topic it was given.** `chatId:topic:N` was parsed
  off the target and a `threadId` parameter was accepted, then both were
  dropped before the query was built: every read of a forum returned the whole
  chat with all topics interleaved, which looks like a correct answer to the
  wrong question. The topic now reaches Telegram as `replyTo`, and `read`
  accepts it as `threadId` / `topicId` / `messageThreadId` beside the target.

## [2.15.0] — 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- **Markdown arrived as literal asterisks on html-mode accounts.** 2026-08-12
  00:13 UTC a 2167-character monthly report reached a work chat as
  `**Разбор работы…**`, markers showing on every line. The agent writes what
  language models write — markdown, or markdown mixed with the HTML links it
  is told to use — while GramJS's HTML parser converts tags only and ships
  the markdown through untouched. Its markdown mode is no way out: five
  delimiters, no links, so the HTML half would break instead.

  `parseMode: "html"` now renders the text before sending. Markdown becomes
  Telegram entities (`**b**`, `*i*`, `_i_`, `~~s~~`, `||spoiler||`, `` `code` ``,
  fenced blocks with language, `[text](url)`, `# headings` as bold lines,
  `> quotes` as blockquotes), hand-authored Telegram HTML passes through with
  its attributes intact — `<a href>` links keep working — structural HTML
  (`<ul>`, `<p>`, …) is dropped exactly as the parser already dropped it, and
  stray `<`, `>`, `&` are escaped so they reach the reader as text: a
  `<placeholder>` the old path swallowed whole now survives. Markdown inside
  code spans, fences and `<code>`/`<pre>` bodies is never converted.
  Conversion runs at the transport, so replies, core-delivered text, `send`
  actions and captions all render the same way.

- **"Plain text" was never plain.** An absent parse mode does not disable
  parsing in GramJS — it falls back to GramJS's *default markdown parser*,
  which has quietly eaten `**` and backticks out of "raw" sends since the
  fork began. The documented escape hatch (`parseMode: ""`) now resolves to
  the new explicit mode `"none"`, which really does deliver the text exactly
  as typed (`parseMode: false` at the GramJS boundary). An *unset* account
  mode keeps the historical GramJS default unchanged.

### Added

- **Captions render like messages.** `sendMedia` accepts `parseMode`; the
  outbound media path and the `upload-file` action resolve it exactly like
  text sends (per-call wins, account `replyParseMode` otherwise). Captions
  are the same agent prose — before this they always took GramJS's default
  markdown pass, a third rendering behavior nobody configured.

## [2.14.0] — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **A reply could greet whoever spoke last instead of whoever asked.** Live in
  a work chat: the owner asked at 15:33, a colleague asked something else at
  15:35, and the answer to the owner went out as `@colleague, готово` — the
  colleague read a result they had not asked for, while the owner's request
  looked ignored.

  The channel remembers a reply address per incoming message, but also kept a
  `__latest__` entry so that a send carrying no `replyToId` still greeted
  somebody. In an interleaved chat that "somebody" is the most recent sender.
  Recency is not an answer to "who am I replying to": the fallback is gone, and
  `message.action send` now resolves the address from `toolContext
  .currentMessageId` — the message the turn is actually answering. No message
  to answer, no greeting.

- **Every request was answered twice.** The agent replies by calling `send`,
  then returns text as well, and core delivers that text as a second message:
  `handleAction send` at 12:39:02, `outbound sendText` at 12:39:09 — the same
  answer in different words, twice in a row, for two different requests.

  Core's convention is that an agent which already sent a message answers
  `NO_REPLY`; this catches the turns that forget. A send into the chat the turn
  came from is now recorded, and core's delivery of that turn's final text is
  dropped as an echo. The window is 20 seconds — measured against the live
  7-second gap — so a result the assistant genuinely comes back with later is
  still delivered. The echo record is kept apart from the existing
  ten-minute duplicate guard: feeding one from the other would have quietly
  made that rule stricter.

## [2.13.1] — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **`dryRun` inside `params` was silently ignored, and the message went out
  for real.** Core passes the flag as a sibling of `params`; callers write it
  inside `params`, next to `to` and `text`, because that is where every other
  parameter lives. There it was read by nobody.

  This is the worst possible failure for a safety flag, and it has now put two
  irreversible messages into a work chat. 2026-08-08 (note 0066), and again
  2026-08-10 at 02:49 UTC, when a rehearsal posted a bare `ping` (id 2360).
  The agent immediately tried `message.action delete` — this channel has no
  delete action — and ended up apologising for it in its own report.

  Either position now counts, and a disagreement between them resolves toward
  **not** sending: a caller who wrote "dry run" anywhere meant it somewhere.
  The string `"true"` is accepted alongside the boolean, as elsewhere in the
  action parameters.

## [2.13.0] — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- **`send` now inherits the account's parse mode instead of defaulting to
  plain text.** The two send paths disagreed: replies used
  `accounts.*.replyParseMode`, while the `send` action took `parseMode` per
  call and fell back to plain when it was omitted. An account configured for
  `html` therefore rendered replies as HTML and tool-driven sends as raw
  markup.

  On 2026-08-09 at 22:30 UTC a long answer arrived in a work chat with
  `**Вне каталога — Telegram**` visible. Two sends half an hour earlier had
  passed `parseMode` by hand and looked right — which is the tell rather than
  the reassurance: correctness that depends on remembering a parameter on
  every call is correctness that will lapse.

  The per-call parameter still wins, and `parseMode: ""` still means "send it
  exactly as typed" — the escape hatch for text holding characters HTML would
  choke on. Only the default changed.

  A configured account is a **behaviour change for existing sends**: text that
  previously went out raw is now parsed. Set `parseMode: ""` on any call that
  must stay literal.

## [2.12.1] — 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- **The do-not-judge-people rule was swallowing the praise rule.** Live:
  "ладно, молодец тина" produced `chose: "none"`, and "самой умной в этой
  ситуации оказалась тина" produced 😁 rather than the `❤` 2.11.0 fixed for
  praise. Neither was a delivery failure — the mention was seen, the turn was
  silent, the reaction step ran, and the model declined on purpose.

  It was following the prompt exactly. The restraint clause read "answer NONE
  when the message … discusses a person's performance", and "молодец тина" is
  literally that. The carve-out the assistant has in its own rules — the ban on
  judging people protects *others*, not itself — was never repeated here.

  The clause is now scoped to someone *else's* work or behaviour, with the
  exemption spelled out, plus an explicit precedence line: when a fixed answer
  applies, it beats the mood rule.

## [2.12.0] — 2026-08-09

### Added

- **Chat management: the assistant can now assemble a team chat, not only
  speak in it.** Seven new message actions — `createGroup`, `addMembers`,
  `removeMember`, `promoteAdmin`, `demoteAdmin`, `transferOwnership`,
  `inviteLink` — all driven by the same personal MTProto account; Telegram's
  Bot API forbids most of this to bots, which is why the capability lives
  here. The trigger was live: asked to remove two people from a group, the
  assistant had to answer that reading, reacting and sending was all it could
  do there.

  Everything is opt-in behind the new `accounts.*.manageChats` scope, whose
  default is the exact opposite of `readChats`: absent or empty means manage
  *nothing*, `["*"]` means every chat. A non-empty list also unlocks
  `createGroup` — the chat being created is not in any list yet. `dryRun` is
  honoured everywhere, after the gate, so a dry run exercises the same
  refusals a real call would hit. People's ids stay out of the channel log;
  results carry them to the caller, the journal does not.

  The shape of each action follows what Telegram actually permits:

  - `createGroup` creates a supergroup (megagroup), because granular admin
    rights, bans and ownership transfer only exist there;
  - people whose privacy settings refuse a direct add come back in `missing`
    rather than failing the batch — `inviteLink` is the path for them;
  - `removeMember` kicks softly by default (ban, then lift, so the person can
    be re-invited); `ban: true` keeps the ban;
  - `promoteAdmin` grants a run-the-room default set; `addAdmins` and
    `anonymous` are escalation and impersonation, so each stays off unless
    set explicitly in `rights`;
  - `transferOwnership` exchanges the account's 2FA password for an SRP proof
    in-process — the password comes from the new `accounts.*.twoFaPassword`
    (literal or SecretRef, `sensitive` in uiHints, on the forbidden-log-keys
    list), never from action parameters. Telegram's own restrictions surface
    as errors: supergroups only, 2FA older than 7 days
    (`PASSWORD_TOO_FRESH_*`), session older than 24 h (`SESSION_TOO_FRESH_*`),
    new owner already an admin.

## [2.11.0] — 2026-08-09

### Changed

- **Three reactions are now fixed rather than left to the model's taste.**
  First working run reacted 👍 to "самая умная в этой ситуации оказалась
  тина" — defensible, and wrong: 👍 approves of the praise instead of being
  touched by it. The owner named the mapping:

  - praised, thanked, or spoken well of → `❤` (explicitly never 👍)
  - asked or told to do something → `🫡`, or `👌` for a small routine request
  - anything about producing something written → `✍`

  Everything else still follows the mood rule, and the NONE rule for
  conflictual or evaluative messages is unchanged and still wins.

  `❤` and `✍` are written as bare U+2764 and U+270D in the prompt, with a test
  asserting no U+FE0F crept in: the prompt is a second way to reintroduce the
  2.10.1 bug, since the model copies back what it is shown.

## [2.10.1] — 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- **The silent-mention reaction reached Telegram and was refused.** First live
  run, message 2228:

  ```
  clawgram silent-mention reaction         { messageId: 2228, appetite: 'extensive', chose: 'emoji' }
  clawgram silent-mention reaction failed  { error: 'RPCError: 400: REACTION_INVALID (caused by messages.SendReaction)' }
  ```

  Every step worked — mention seen, turn silent, emoji chosen — and the send
  failed. Reactions are not "any emoji": Telegram keeps a fixed set, and five
  of its members carry **no** variation selector (`❤` is U+2764 alone, likewise
  `⚡`, `✍`, `🕊`, `☃`). The parser preserved the U+FE0F models emit by habit,
  and a test even asserted it did — the wrong contract, verified.

  Now the answer is canonicalized (U+FE0F and skin-tone modifiers stripped) and
  matched against the reaction set; the set is also handed to the model up
  front, so it picks from what Telegram will take instead of being corrected
  afterwards.

- **Chats that restrict reactions are honoured.** `availableReactions` is read
  off the full chat: `ChatReactionsSome` narrows both the prompt and the
  validation, and `ChatReactionsNone` skips the step entirely without spending
  a model call. A failed lookup falls back to the full set — not knowing is not
  the same as being forbidden.

### Changed

- **The decision log carries the emoji and the size of the allowed set.** The
  body stays out, as always, but the reaction is our own act, and the first
  live failure could not be diagnosed from `chose: "emoji"` alone.

## [2.10.0] — 2026-08-09

### Added

- **The channel now reacts when the agent is addressed and says nothing.**
  Named in a group, nothing worth replying — an emoji goes on the message
  instead of silence. The emoji is picked per message by a small model call
  (`maxTokens: 8`), so it answers the mood rather than stamping a fixed ack.

  This is the fourth attempt at the feature and the first that does not go
  through the prompt. 2.8.0 added `reactionGuidance`, 2.9.0 moved the same text
  onto `messageToolHints`; instrumentation on both showed **zero invocations**
  across live turns while the assembled prompt stayed byte-identical at 44 266
  chars. Core resolves the channel for prompt assembly from
  `params.messageChannel ?? params.messageProvider`, which is empty on this
  path — so nothing this channel contributes to the prompt has ever reached the
  agent. Three rewrites of the workspace rule were arguing with a delivery
  failure.

  The decision now sits in code, at the one unambiguous moment: the turn was
  addressed to her and delivered nothing. Guardrails:

  - only when she was addressed — an `@`-mention or a reply to her own message,
    the same sense of "addressed" the turn itself was given;
  - `reactionLevel` still governs: `off`/`ack` react never, `minimal` is told to
    be sparing, `extensive` to be generous;
  - the model is told to answer `NONE` on conflictual or evaluative messages —
    an emoji on "Петя опять сорвал сроки" is a public verdict on a colleague;
  - anything that is not a bare emoji is discarded rather than sent hopefully;
  - every failure degrades to no reaction. The reply is already settled when
    this runs, so nothing here can break a turn.

  Groups only. A silent DM is a different problem and gets no reaction.

### Changed

- **The silent-reply branch now keys on her silence, not on the transcript.**
  It previously required a transcript entry that stripped to empty; a turn that
  wrote no entry at all fell through to a bare warning. Both are equally silent
  and are now handled together.

### Removed

- **`reactionGuidance`, and the reaction text on `messageToolHints`.** Both are
  dead weight: neither hook is called for this channel, proven by logging
  rather than inferred. `reactionLevel` keeps its meaning and now steers the
  code path above. A comment in `channel.ts` records why prompt text must not
  be re-added there.

## [2.9.0] — 2026-08-09

### Changed

- **Reaction guidance moved into `messageToolHints`, because core never asks
  for it.** 2.8.1 added a log line to the `reactionGuidance` hook. Across live
  turns it printed **nothing**, while the assembled prompt stayed byte-identical
  — so core was not calling the hook at all, and the earlier reasoning that the
  model simply declined to react had been resting on a hook that never ran.

  Both resolvers sit in the same core function, two lines apart:

  ```
  messageToolHints = runtimeChannel ? resolve(...) : undefined
  reactionGuidance = runtimeChannel && params.config ? resolve(...) : undefined
  ```

  The extra `params.config` is the only structural difference, and it lives in
  the minified `openclaw` dependency — not ours to change, and patching
  `node_modules` would vanish on the next update.

  So the guidance now rides the hints, which are guarded only by the channel
  resolving. The workaround does not depend on that diagnosis being right: if
  the hints reach the prompt, so does the text. Wording follows core's own, so
  nothing changes should core ever start calling the hook.

  `reactionGuidance` is kept as-is for that day. Both paths log, so "did our
  text reach the prompt" stays answerable from the log instead of by inference
  — which is what cost three rewrites of the workspace rule.

## [2.8.1] — 2026-08-09

### Changed

- **`reactionGuidance` logs when core calls it.** 2.8.0 shipped the hook, the
  server proved it returns `{level:"extensive"}` when invoked by hand, and the
  config validated — yet the assembled system prompt stayed byte-identical,
  with no `## Reactions` section. "The hook answers correctly" and "core asked
  it" are different questions, and nothing in the logs could tell them apart.

  One info line per invocation carrying the resolved account, the requested
  account and the configured level. Silence in the log now means core never
  called the hook, which is a different defect from the hook declining.

## [2.8.0] — 2026-08-09

### Added

- **The prompt now tells the agent that reacting exists.** Core has a whole
  reactions subsystem a channel opts into: it calls
  `agentPrompt.reactionGuidance`, and when a channel returns a level it injects
  a `## Reactions` section into the system prompt — "React ONLY when truly
  relevant" for `minimal`, "react whenever it feels natural" for `extensive`.

  clawgram never implemented the hook, so that section was absent entirely.
  The `react` action was advertised and available, and the agent used it the
  moment she was asked point blank in a DM — but never once on her own in a
  group, across every turn in the logs. Three rewrites of the owner's
  workspace rule failed against a prompt that otherwise never mentioned
  reactions at all.

  New account setting `reactionLevel`: `off` / `ack` / `minimal` /
  `extensive`, absent means `minimal`, an invalid value disables agent
  reactions rather than guessing. Levels and fallbacks mirror the bundled
  Telegram channel so the same config behaves the same way in both.

## [2.7.1] — 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- **A synthesized voice reply could never leave a group.** `outbound.sendMedia`
  is the path core uses to deliver TTS audio, and it passed the target to peer
  resolution with the `clawgram:` prefix still attached — `sendText`, two
  functions above, has always called `normalizeOutboundTarget`. The send threw,
  no `sendMedia completed` line ever followed, the dispatch counters stayed at
  zero, and the transcript fallback posted the reply as raw text instead.

  The same function also dropped `audioAsVoice`, core's own signal that the
  file is a voice note, so even a successful send would have produced a grey
  audio document.

  Direct messages never hit either defect: that path goes through the
  `upload-file` action, which normalizes the target and reads the flag. The
  bug needed a group — and a voice reply — to become visible.

- **TTS markup no longer reaches a human.** The transcript fallback rescues a
  reply that would otherwise vanish, and it does that by reading the
  assistant's raw text out of the session file. Core strips `[[tts:…]]` markup
  before a channel sees it, but only on the normal reply path — so the
  fallback shipped it verbatim, and a group chat received
  `@example_owner, [[tts:text]]Привет, Вася! …[[/tts:text]]`.

  The fallback now strips directives the same way it already stripped the
  silent-reply token. `[[tts:text]]…[[/tts:text]]` is **unwrapped** rather than
  dropped: those are the words the agent meant to say, so a synthesis that did
  not happen degrades to readable text instead of to markup — or to nothing,
  which is what happened the first time this path misfired.

## [2.7.0] — 2026-08-08

### Added

- **Synthesized speech arrives as a voice message, not a file card.** The
  channel now advertises `capabilities.tts.voice.synthesisTarget: "voice-note"`.
  Core resolves that key through `resolveChannelTtsVoiceDelivery` and falls
  back to `"audio-file"` when it is absent — which is why TTS audio used to
  land as a grey document you had to download before you knew what it was.
  With the capability advertised, core marks such sends with `asVoice` (older
  callers send `audioAsVoice`); both are read, and the upload path passes
  `voiceNote` to GramJS, which builds `DocumentAttributeAudio(voice: true)`
  itself.

  `transcodesAudio` is deliberately **not** advertised: the plugin ships no
  ffmpeg and adds no dependencies, so core keeps producing Ogg/Opus — the only
  container Telegram renders as a voice bubble.

  `capabilities` is now annotated with core's own `ChannelCapabilities` type.
  The block is read by reaching into it by path, so a typo would not fail —
  it would silently resolve to a default. With the annotation it is a build
  error instead (verified: a bad `synthesisTarget` gives `TS2820`).

## [2.6.1] — 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **A `send` carrying a file no longer drops it.** `openclaw message send
  --media photo.jpg` is a documented invocation and arrives as action `send`
  with the file among the params; the text path ignored those params, so the
  caption went out and the picture did not. Found immediately after 2.6.0 while
  verifying the new action live. A `send` with a file now takes the same route
  as `upload-file`; a `send` without one is untouched.

## [2.6.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added

- **Files can be sent, not just described.** `sendMedia` was implemented from
  the start, but the channel never advertised it: `describeMessageTool` listed
  every action except `upload-file`, so core had no way to hand the agent a
  file and the agent had no way to ask. It failed as a shrug rather than an
  error — asked to draw a cat, the agent generated the image, watched core
  resize it, and then answered "Вот кот 🐱" in plain text while the PNG sat on
  disk. `upload-file` is now advertised (with `sendAttachment` accepted as the
  legacy alias) and routed to `sendMedia`, and `mediaSourceParams` tells core
  which params carry the file so sandboxed paths are normalized. Caption
  handling matches `send`, including refusing to post the `NO_REPLY` sentinel —
  a sentinel caption drops the caption, never the file.

## [2.5.1] — 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **Images are actually read now.** 2.5.0 fetched them and then failed with
  `Image understanding requires agentDir`: image models are called with the
  agent's own credentials, so the pipeline refuses to run without that path.
  Audio never needed it, which is why voice notes worked while pictures did
  not. The plugin now resolves the documented agent directory and checks it
  exists before use — a missing directory degrades to "attachment not read"
  instead of throwing.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added

- **Voice notes and images arrive as readable messages.** A message whose whole
  content was an attachment used to be dropped as `skipping empty inbound
  text`: with no text there was nothing to hand the agent, so being sent a
  voice note looked exactly like the assistant being offline. Inbound voice,
  audio and images are now fetched and read through
  `runtime.mediaUnderstanding` — speech becomes a transcript, a picture becomes
  a description — and the result lands in the message body prefixed with
  `[голосовое]` or `[изображение]`, so the agent knows it is reading a
  machine's reading and not typed words.

  A caption is kept and the reading appended after it: "look at this" plus the
  picture is one thought, not two.

  Which backend does the reading stays out of this plugin — that is the
  installation's `tools.media.*` choice, local model or hosted, and it can
  change without touching the channel.

### Notes

- Attachments this channel does not read (documents, video, stickers) keep the
  old treatment: metadata only. "spec.pdf, 240 KB" already tells a reader what
  happened, and fetching every attachment would be a different feature with
  different costs. An image sent *as a file* is read anyway — only the
  envelope differs, the pixels are the message.
- Reads are capped at 25 MB and the cap is checked against the size Telegram
  reports, before any transfer.
- A failed read never drops the message. The turn proceeds without the
  attachment text, because saying "you sent something I could not read" beats
  silence, which is indistinguishable from being offline.

## [2.4.3] — 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **Subagent announces and `--deliver` reach the chat.** Core's
  `resolveAgentDeliveryPlanWithSessionRoute` calls `outbound.resolveTarget`
  without await; an async hook hands it a Promise, `.ok` reads undefined and
  the error branch crashes on `error.message` — which is why every subagent
  completion announce into a group session gave up at the retry limit. The
  hook is now synchronous (peer resolution already happens in `sendText`)
  and a not-ok result carries an Error-like `error`, since core reads
  `error.message`. Await-based call sites are unaffected: awaiting a plain
  value is a no-op.

## [2.4.2] — 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **`outbound.resolveTarget` can no longer take down the gateway.** Core's
  agent-delivery path (`--deliver`, subagent completion announces) calls it
  with `to: undefined` when a delivery has no explicit target and the
  session route yields none — and does not catch a rejection from the hook.
  The old code called `.trim()` through the target-kind helper and threw,
  which surfaced as an unhandled rejection and killed the whole gateway
  process (systemd restart, live case 2026-08-06 18:27 UTC: a research
  subagent died with it). The hook now never rejects: missing target,
  missing runtime and resolver failures all answer `{ ok: false, error }`,
  which is the contract core's own fallback path implements.

## [2.4.1] — 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **The transcript fallback no longer echoes old replies.** It exists to
  salvage a reply that reached the transcript but not stdout; on a turn
  that aborted with zero output it instead salvaged the newest entry —
  by definition from an earlier turn — and re-sent an old answer to a new
  question. Live case: a turn tripped over a dead background workflow,
  aborted in 664ms, and the previous reply went out twice to two different
  questions. The fallback now takes the dispatch start time and refuses
  anything stamped earlier (or not stamped at all); a static test pins the
  call site to keep passing it.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-08-06

### Added

- **Highlighted replies reach the agent.** Telegram lets a reply point at a
  fragment of the message it answers; the fragment travels on
  `MessageReplyHeader.quoteText`, not in the reply text. clawgram never read
  it, so the gesture was invisible: the agent saw the reply and the parent
  id, and nothing about which line was being pointed at. Lifted into
  `NormalizedInbound.replyQuoteText` / `.replyIsQuote` and passed as
  `ReplyToQuoteText` / `ReplyToIsQuote` at both inbound sites; core already
  renders those as `[Replying to: "…"]` when the provider is telegram, so no
  format is invented here. History (`read`) carries `replyQuoteText` too —
  reconstructing a conversation from a window is exactly where a reply
  stripped of its highlight reads as an answer to the whole parent message.

  The flag is not trusted on its own: the text is the evidence, and blank
  text counts as no highlight. A static guard asserts that every site
  passing `ReplyToId` also passes the quote — the two sites (group and DM)
  are linked by nothing in the type system, and wiring one while forgetting
  the other would work in groups and silently do nothing in DMs.

## [2.3.3] — 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **`replyParseMode` actually reaches the client.** 2.3.1 added the setting
  and 2.3.2 taught the schema to accept it, but `resolveAccount` builds the
  plugin config field by field and never copied it — so the setting
  validated, deployed, restarted and did nothing, twice. Now carried
  through, with a regression test on `resolveAccount` itself. **Rule for
  every future account setting: `src/` + manifest schema + `resolveAccount`
  + tests, in one commit.**

## [2.3.2] — 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **`replyParseMode` is accepted by the manifest schema.** 2.3.1 taught the
  code to read the key, but the account schema kept
  `additionalProperties: false` without declaring it, so writing the
  documented setting made `openclaw config validate` fail on production and
  the change had to be rolled back. Same shape as the `readChats` gap before
  1.3.1 — now covered by tests that validate every value the code accepts.

## [2.3.1] — 2026-08-06

### Added

- **`replyParseMode` on the account** (`markdown` / `md` / `html`) — the
  format for replies. 2.3.0 added `parseMode` to the `send` action, but a
  reply to a mention goes through the reply pipeline, which has no
  per-call slot: markup in a reply reached the recipient as raw brackets.
  The value is validated when read, so a typo fails at start-up rather
  than shipping `<a href=…>` to a live human. Absent means plain text,
  exactly as before 2.3.1.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-08-06

### Added

- **`parseMode` on the `send` action** (`"markdown"` / `"md"` / `"html"`).
  The value is validated at the action boundary — an unknown mode fails
  loudly instead of delivering markup as literal text to a live human —
  and reaches GramJS as its `md`/`html` parse mode. Absent means plain
  text: every pre-2.3.0 caller behaves exactly as before. Requested by
  the owner so assistant digests can carry real links (`[title](url)`)
  instead of bare URLs.
- **ClawHub publishing runs in the release pipeline**, in the step after npm. It was manual, and
  ClawHub fell two versions behind because of it. The step skips itself when `CLAWHUB_TOKEN` is
  unset — npm still publishes — and skips again when ClawHub already carries the version, so
  re-running a release is harmless.
- **`npm run release:clawhub`** publishes to ClawHub from a local machine, for when the token is
  deliberately kept out of GitHub. Same guards as the CI step: refuses without a login or a tag,
  points at the commit npm was built from, no-ops when the version is already there.

## [2.2.2] — 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- **The plugin declared two different versions.** `openclaw.plugin.json` still said `2.1.0` while
  `package.json` said `2.2.1`; both 2.2.0 and 2.2.1 shipped that way. npm reads `package.json`, so
  the published package and the Gateway reported the right version and nothing looked wrong — only
  ClawHub's inspector flagged the drift, on publish. A test now ties the two declarations together,
  verified red-green.

## [2.2.1] — 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- **SecretRefs were rejected by the plugin's own config schema.** 2.2.0 shipped the resolver, the
  runtime guards and the documentation, but left `apiHash` and `sessionString` declared as
  `{"type": "string"}` in `openclaw.plugin.json` — so `openclaw config validate` refused a config
  that used a reference, and the feature could not be switched on at all. Found while applying it
  to a live Gateway, which is the wrong place to find it. All four credential fields
  (`apiHash`, `sessionString`, `proxy.username`, `proxy.password`) now accept a literal string or a
  `{ source, provider, id }` reference, matching how core models `SecretInput`. An incomplete
  reference, an unknown source and a non-string are still rejected — a typo must not be mistaken
  for a reference and silently blank a credential.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-08-03

Four capabilities the channel was missing, and two defects where it promised more than it did.

### Added

- **SecretRefs for credentials.** `apiHash`, `sessionString`, `proxy.username` and `proxy.password`
  accept `{ source, provider, id }` in place of a literal, resolved once per account at start-up.
  Previously these could only be plaintext in `openclaw.json` — including `sessionString`, a bearer
  credential for the entire Telegram account. An unresolvable reference fails the account and names
  the field, never the value, and the client refuses construction while any reference remains, so an
  unresolved secret cannot reach Telegram as `"[object Object]"`.
- **Chat metadata.** The `chatInfo` action (also `getChatInfo`, `chatMetadata`, `getChatMetadata`)
  reports what a chat is: title, type (direct/group/supergroup/channel), member count, description,
  whether it is a forum, the pinned message id, and — for direct chats — whether the other side is
  a bot. Gated by `readChats`, the same scope that gates reading history. Previously the assistant
  could read a chat but not name it, so a chat's identity had to come from a hand-maintained
  allowlist that goes stale as soon as someone renames it.
- **Attachments are visible when reading history.** `read` now reports a `media` field with the
  attachment kind (photo, video, voice, audio, document, sticker, poll, geo, contact, webpage),
  plus filename, MIME type, size and duration where Telegram provides them. Previously a message
  whose whole content was a screenshot arrived as empty text, indistinguishable from a message
  that said nothing. Metadata only — nothing is downloaded.
- **Emoji reactions.** The `react` action of the message tool adds or clears this account's
  reaction on a message, following the tool contract: an empty `emoji` clears, and `remove: true`
  clears but still requires a non-empty `emoji`. The chat and message are taken from tool context
  when not passed explicitly, so reacting in place needs no arguments beyond the emoji.

### Fixed

- **`NO_REPLY` could be posted as a message.** `message.action` is neither the inbound pipeline
  (which strips the silent token) nor a core-normalized reply payload (which core strips), so an
  explicit send carried whatever text it was given straight to Telegram. The SDK itself prompts
  agents to send a message and *then* answer `NO_REPLY`, leaving the two one slip apart. Both
  `message.action` and `outbound.sendText` now suppress a payload that is only the token, and the
  check runs before the reply-address prefix is applied — prefixing first leaves `"Name: "` in
  front of the token, which is not empty, and that is precisely how the token reached the inbound
  path once before. A token in the middle of a sentence is still content and still delivered.
- `capabilities.reactions` was `true` while nothing implemented reactions — the channel promised
  the Gateway a capability that failed when the agent used it. The flag and the action are now
  tied together by a test in both directions.

## [2.1.1] — 2026-08-03

**Never published.** The version existed to rehearse the new release pipeline, which it did; 2.2.0
superseded it before a tag was cut, so npm goes straight from 2.1.0 to 2.2.0. The plugin code was
identical to 2.1.0.

### Added

- GitHub Actions: `ci.yml` builds and tests every push and pull request on Node 22 and 24;
  `release.yml` publishes to npm from a `v*` tag, with provenance and a tag/`package.json`
  version check. Releases no longer depend on one laptop, and `workflow_dispatch` runs the
  same job as a rehearsal that stops at `npm publish --dry-run`.
- `prepublishOnly` runs build and tests, so a hand-run `npm publish` cannot ship a stale `dist/`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) and a Releases section in the README.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-08-03

Published to npm and ClawHub; rolled out to the server the same day.

### Fixed

- The channel logged the **full text of outgoing messages**. Only `textLength` is logged now.
- `--auth` printed the `sessionString` — an account bearer credential — to stdout unconditionally.
  It is shown only when the config is not written automatically, and then behind an explicit warning.
- README carried a realistic-looking session string example; replaced with a non-secret placeholder.

### Changed

- `compat` / `peerDependencies` raised to OpenClaw `>=2026.5.26`. Earlier releases carry published
  high-severity advisories, including restoration of revoked node-token permissions.

Both leaks are now covered by static tests (`test/no-secret-logging.test.ts`), each verified red-green.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-08-03

Never published — superseded by 2.1.0 the same day.

### Changed

- Build and test against the OpenClaw SDK version the server actually runs.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-08-02

### Changed

- **Breaking:** plugin id and channel renamed to `clawgram`. Config moves from
  `channels.telegram-userbot` to `channels.clawgram`; `message.action` calls must pass
  `channel: clawgram`.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Package rebranded to `clawgram`.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-08-02

### Added

- Opt-in display names in `participants`, for linking Telegram identities to people.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-08-02

### Added

- Read-only `participants` and `joins` actions; `readChats` is honoured.

## [1.1.2] — 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- History reads failed on ids that GramJS carries as big-integer objects.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Silent-token handling on the reply path.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-01

### Added

- `read` action — history reading through the Gateway RPC.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- The test build could emit no test files and still report green; it now fails loudly.
