/**
 * Every accepted spelling of an action, mapped to its canonical name.
 *
 * One table, not three. The synonyms used to live in
 * `CORE_ACTION_SYNONYMS`, again in `MANAGE_ACTION_ALIASES`, and a third time
 * as `action === "…" || …` chains inside the dispatcher — and the dispatcher
 * read only the chains. A name could therefore be added to a table and to the
 * advertised list and still reach nothing, with the suite none the wiser:
 * it only ever dispatched the native spellings (finding A6-10).
 *
 * `canonicalAction` is now the only place a name is resolved, and
 * `CORE_ACTION_SYNONYMS` below is derived from this table rather than kept
 * beside it.

/**
 * Core's own name for a clawgram action, and the only thing that makes the
 * action reachable from the agent's `message` tool.
 *
 * Core keys its target policy by `CHANNEL_MESSAGE_ACTION_NAMES`, and an action
 * outside that vocabulary is simultaneously "requires a target" and "does not
 * accept a target" — there is no call that satisfies both. Declaring `chatId`
 * through `messageActionTargetAliases` looks like the fix and is not: core
 * resolves the channel with `getBootstrapChannelPlugin`, which only knows
 * bundled channels, so a plugin channel's declaration is never read. Measured
 * on 2026-08-30 — `thread-list` reached `handleAction` and `topics` did not,
 * from the same caller, on the same chat.
 *
 * Every name on the right maps to core target mode `"none"` except
 * `channel-info`, which is `"channelId"`: the chat arrives in
 * `params.channelId`, a spelling no parser here read until 2.21.0 — so the
 * call fell through to the current chat and answered about the wrong one.
 * `readChatTargetParam` is the single list of accepted spellings now.
 *
 * `edit` (2.29.0) is the third shape: core resolves it as a *message* target,
 * so both the chat and `messageId` arrive named. It needs no synonym — the
 * name core uses is the name this channel uses — and it is listed here only so
 * the suite asserts core still knows it.
 *
 * These spellings are derived from `ACTION_ALIASES` rather than kept beside
 * it; that core actually knows each of them is asserted against the installed
 * core in `core-action-synonyms.test.ts`.
